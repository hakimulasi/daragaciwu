Vanessa, who I worked with on Outlander, is brilliant and she created an atmosphere and a safe space and a place for us to really inject more intimacy, or what appears to be more intimacy, without having to make people uncomfortable."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/8fa8cef27fbf-sam-couple-next-door-as-danny.png><p id=ejXFQEsH4I1 data-wc=34>also stars actress Jessica De Gouw as Sam's on-screen wife, Becka, and actor, Alfred Enoch, as Evie's husband, Pete Thomas.</p><p id=eLU_OurDCuC data-wc=76>The synopsis reads: "When Evie and Pete move into an upscale neighbourhood, they find themselves in a world of curtain twitching and status anxiety.
