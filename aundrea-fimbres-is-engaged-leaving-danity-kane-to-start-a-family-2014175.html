Danity Kane’s <strong>Aundrea Fimbres</strong> announced she’s engaged and leaving the group to start a family during their kick-off #DKNoFilterTour performance in San Francisco, Calif., on Friday, May 16.</p><p>“I do have to say one thing if you guys don’t know. I just recently got engaged,” the 30-year-old said to a screaming crowd. “Two dreams of mine have been to be a singer and be on stage like this and to have a family. In a couple of months, that’s all about to come true. I’m going to get married…”</p><p>“I’ve gotten to do some amazing things with Danity Kane, but it’s time for me to start the next chapter in my life,” she tearfully continued. “So I thank you guys from the bottom of my heart…I love you so much. And I just wanted you guys to know from me.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all"><p>Fimbres, who broke out in the music industry in MTV’s Making the Band in 2005, brought her step-daughter on stage during the emotional goodbye, but reassured fans that now former bandmates <a href=#><strong>Aubrey O’Day</strong></a>,<strong> Dawn Richard</strong>, and <strong>Shannon Bex</strong> had a bright future.</p><p>“They are going to kill it for you,” she said. “While I go and have some babies!” (The identity of her husband-to-be is unknown.)&nbsp;</p><p>Danity Kane reunited after splitting in 2009 at the MTV Video Music Awards last August, and confirmed their comeback. Member <strong>D. Woods</strong>, however, exclusively told <strong>Us</strong> at the time that she would <a href=#>not be rejoining</a> the female group. On May 15, they dropped their <a href=#>single “Lemonade,”</a> which Fimbres was seemingly absent from. Only three women were shown on its cover art.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGicp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX6OyuL%2BOmqynnKKarm6yyKaZq52jYra0ecSnnpqflZl6rbHAr6Cnn12Zrq%2B107JkpJmemnq1u4ysq5qqpGKubrLApqClsV1nfXKAkHBs</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JamBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
