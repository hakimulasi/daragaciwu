He's also, as the Wall Street Journal recently reported, the new owner of a large, five-bedroom mansion in Beverly Hills, a home he purchased for the reported sum of $37 million â€“ a bit lower than the asking price it was listed for.</p><p>The new Friedman house is one of those homes that's upscale and important enough to have its own proper name: "the Promontory." The Promontory was first listed back in May for $46.75 million, then for $39.95 million, so the $37 million price was something of a bargain for Friedman.</p><p>The house measures in at about 11,000 square feet, with a blend of architectural styles, primarily Hollywood Regency as well as the characteristic style of Palm Beach. Inside you'll find a mid-century-style bar (despite the house having only been constructed recently), a screening room, and a gym, plus an infinity pool and a garage with room for four cars. Here's part of how the house was described in its official listing:</p><p><strong>"A masterful creation by renowned Architectural designer Tim Morrison, this World-Class modern references elements of Hollywood Regency and the grand estates of Palm Beach. Meticulously crafted interior of approximately 11,000sqft showcasing unparalleled quality. Two-story skylight foyer, grand dining room, formal living room, and mid-century bar all flow effortlessly for entertaining. Spectacular master with explosive jetliner views, sitting room and dual baths. Additional features include a sumptuous screening room, 4 bedrooms, gym, and gourmet kitchen. One of the few drive-on view estates, behind gates with a vast motor court and 4 car garage. The rear grounds offer spectacular formal gardens and dramatic floating zero edge pool. Destined to be a legend."</strong></p><p>You can take a look at the future legend known as the Promontory in the video below, courtesy of Berlyn Media:</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue8Crq6KbnJrAcK%2FEpZybqpmpxm60zqacrGeinXqmxMScrK2hppp6qK3RsmSfqpmasa6tzWaZrrGjYq%2BmwsSro7JlmJ65rb%2BMqamopZ%2BjwbC%2B2GadqKpdaIRuucilo6KnnmQ%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JamBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
