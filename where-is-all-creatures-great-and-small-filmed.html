For example, a local bookshop, The Stripey Badger, was used to show a greengrocer. Meanwhile, a pub named The Devonshire, was used to film exterior scenes for the fictional pub, The Drovers Arms, while The Green Dragon in Hardraw doubled as its interior until series three.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/1f886b4cf1e8-all-creatures-z.jpg><p id=eyEajXvvHK data-wc=44>Whilst chatting to HELLO! and other journalists ahead of the Christmas special, Samuel West, who plays Siegfried Farnon, revealed that a new set of The Drovers was built for series three and is used for a community Christmas celebration in the upcoming festive special.&nbsp;</p><p id=ePf1Xfxl3cl data-wc=60>"<strong>We built the new set of The Drovers this year</strong> because the pub we used to shoot in, sadly lost its lease and it wasn't a pub anymore," Samuel explained.

"So as soon as it was possible to do a big scene in the pub, we did one and it's Christmas."</p><p id=egan1jQDOA data-wc=16><strong>MORE:&nbsp;</strong><a class=hm-link href=# rel=noopener>Will All Creatures Great and Small return for series 5?
