Now the target has shifted to The Wizard of Oz, with the release of <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Gale Stay Away From Oz</a></strong>, a fresh film based around the classic 1900&nbsp;L. Frank Baum children’s novel.</p><p data-characters=351 data-current-count=351 data-injectable=false>The movie <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">didn’t stir up nearly so much hype</a> as its competition over in the Hundred Acre Woods, but, despite a slow start for the dark reimagining of the classic fantasy, Gale Stay Away From Oz isn’t without its fans. It was recently released on streaming, but it’s not quite as accessible as our favorite flicks over on Prime Video.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-when-does-gale-stay-away-from-oz-release data-injectable=false>When does Gale Stay Away From Oz release?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=651 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=387 data-current-count=387 data-injectable=false>There wasn’t much marketing in the lead-up to Gale’s release, but once horror hounds learned of the film, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">they were hooked</a>. The independent film is short — only around 30 minutes long — but it’s got plenty of excitement packed into its brief runtime. It was created by independent studio&nbsp;Daniel Alexander&nbsp;Films, and Alexander both wrote and directed the release.</p><p data-characters=418 data-current-count=805 data-injectable=true>It follows Dorothy, now an elderly woman who’s been “broken by years of paranormal entanglement with a mystical realm.” It falls to her only living relative, Emily, to head back into Oz for one last attempt to settle the family’s unfinished business. Gale Stay Away From Oz was released directly to streaming on Sept. 18, 2023. It’s currently available to view, but there’s a catch.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>Where to watch Gale Stay Away From Oz</h2><p data-characters=372 data-current-count=372 data-injectable=false>Gale Stay Away From Oz is only streamable on Chilling, a streaming site specifically dedicated to horror. The film rests alongside a slew of spooky selections on the site, but in order to enjoy it viewers will need to sign up for a paid account or a free trial. The release will likely be made fully free eventually, but it’s still too fresh to ditch the price tag.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJorqGZpGK2tHnToZxmn5Ghsm65zq%2BgnmWimrmmrdKeZJ2ZpJp8</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JamBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
