Before getting her start on the Food Network in the early 2000s, the TV personality was a radio host — which is how she met late icon <a href=#>Prince</a>.</p><p>“My most starstruck moment was sitting within inches of Prince at a private event after a concert for a radio station I worked at,” Anderson told Us. “He was a force!”</p><p>While she considers her encounter with the “Purple Rain” singer her favorite celebrity interaction, Anderson goes with more of a rap vibe if she’s choosing a song for karaoke night. Her go-tos are “Bust a Move” by <strong>Young MC</strong>, “Juicy” by <a href=#>The Notorious B.I.G</a>. or “any song by <a href=#>Tupac</a>,” the <a href=#>Food Network personality</a> revealed. When she just wants to “decompress,” however, Anderson has an entire catalog to choose from.</p><p>“I start by driving home singing off-key at the top of my lungs to songs from the ’80s to early 2000s,” she joked.</p><p>And when it’s time to unwind, the Air Force veteran described her “ideal comfort food” as “food I didn’t make.” Otherwise, Anderson is always down to chow down on some of her “spicy macaroni and cheese,” another one of her go-to meals when she’s in need of some TLC.</p><p>Her favorite dish to prepare, however, is “good huevos rancheros,” Anderson told Us.</p><p>Keep scrolling to learn even more fun facts about Anderson, including the celebrities she’s always mistaken for — and how she couldn’t resist a light-hearted dig at longtime friend <a href=#><strong>Bobby Flay</strong></a>:</p><p>1.
