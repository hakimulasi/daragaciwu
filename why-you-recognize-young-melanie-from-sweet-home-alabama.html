Although it may be hard to believe now, the actor who played the younger version of Reese Witherspoon's character is&nbsp;<a href=#>Dakota Fanning</a>. She was only 7-years-old when the movie got filmed, but that same year it was released, Fanning had been nominated for a SAG award for her role in&nbsp;I Am Sam, making her the youngest nominee in history.</p><p>Fanning went on to have a flourishing career in the years to follow, with lead roles in movies like&nbsp;Uptown Girls&nbsp;and&nbsp;Charlotte's Web. She continued to work as she got older, appearing in the&nbsp;Twilight&nbsp;movies and, most recently, the&nbsp;<a href=#>TNT series&nbsp;The Alienist.</a>&nbsp;In 2016, Fanning spoke about&nbsp;<a href=#>being a child star</a>&nbsp;to&nbsp;<a href=#>The Guardian</a>, saying, "Now there was expectation â€“ to fail, to succeed, to come through to the other side."</p><p>Yet,&nbsp;Sweet Home Alabama&nbsp;wasn't just another movie that helped the actor rise to fame. It had some personal significance as it was where she had her first kiss. She told&nbsp;<a href=#>W Magazine</a>&nbsp;(via&nbsp;<a href=#>Teen Vogue</a>), "In between each take, we would do the kiss, and then I would slowly turn away and wipe my mouth off so he couldn't see...because I was trying to be kind. I wasn't really into it." Hey, she was only 7, and having your first kiss on-screen at any age can't be easy!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmbGxiaoBze9ahsGaxn6p6s7HCqJ6noaqaerq71KeeZqWVoa6vtcRmnaunnWLAuLHErWShp52aeqK4wJuYpplf</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JamBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
