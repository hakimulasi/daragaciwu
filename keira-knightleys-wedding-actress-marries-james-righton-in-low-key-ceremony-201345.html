On Saturday, May 4, the Anna Karenina actress married Klaxons keyboardist <strong>James Righton</strong>, and from the looks of things,&nbsp;there was little ado over the "I dos." The couple kept the day very low-key, exchanging vows in an intimate ceremony in the south of France before just a dozen or so of their closest friends and family. <a href=#>See more photos from Keira Knightley's wedding.</a></p><p>Pictures of the happy occasion show the Oscar-nominated star, 28, leaving the Mazan Town Hall hand-in-hand with her new husband, 29, as guests including Righton's bandmates and Knightley's mom cheer them into a waiting silver Renault Clio. Knightley — in a simple but elegant short, strapless tulle dress by Chanel's Karl Lagerfeld, with flats, a cropped Chanel jacket, and a daisy-chain garland atop her shoulder-length brown tresses — looks radiant and relaxed.</p><p>"It was a very moving ceremony," an onlooker tells <strong>Us Weekly </strong>of the intimate affair, officiated by Mazan mayor Aime Navello. "Keira looked emotional during the whole thing. She cried when they exchanged their vows but was still smiling."</p><p>Another eyewitness adds: "It was a sunny day without a cloud in the sky. There were cheers of 'Well done Keira!' when she came out, but there were so few people present, they didn't make much noise."</p><p>"It was amusing to see them being driven away in a battered old Renault Clio," the onlooker continues. "The car certainly looked as though it had seen better days."</p><p>The newly minted husband and wife will celebrate with a slightly bigger party on Saturday night, at Knightley's mother's home a few miles outside Mazan. Righton's band is expected to perform for the 50 or so guests, rumored to include actress <a href=#>Sienna Miller</a>, and more than 120 bottles of wine have been provided for the fete.&nbsp;The couple also reportedly plan to throw a second bash once they return to Britain.</p><p>Locals in Mazan have grown used to seeing Knightley around town since her mother bought the estate in 2010, and are thrilled to see the A-lister so happy. "We are absolutely delighted for her," Jean-Francois Durand, a near-neighbor, tells <strong>Us</strong>, adding that the family keeps a very low profile.&nbsp;</p><p>This is the first marriage for both the Klaxons rocker and the Pride and Prejudice star, who previously dated actor <strong>Rupert Friend</strong> for five years. Their romance went public in April 2011, when they were photographed kissing in an East London park. A little more than a year later, in May 2012, Righton proposed.</p><p>"He can turn into this lovestruck puppy around her," a mutual pal told <strong><a href=#>Us Weekly</a></strong> last year, adding that the rocker's friends encouraged him to pop the question. "Honestly, they're good for each other."</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Speaking about her wedding plans in November, Knightley confessed to being <a href=#>slightly overwhelmed</a> by the whole thing. "The problem is, ever since [the engagement] happened, everyone keeps going…'So when is it going to happen, and what's the dress like?'" the star told <strong><a href=#>Ellen DeGeneres</a></strong>. "I'm just not one of those girls that's had the kind of fantasy wedding thing, so we haven't planned anything, and it's all quite terrifying."</p><p>"I sort of looked up on the Internet…if you're getting married, what should you do…" she continued. "I really don't have a clue. I don't get what the big deal is. You say 'I do'…You drink a bit…On the Internet, they keep talking about…There are things like bridal tea parties. I mean, what is a bridal tea party? I've never had a tea party in my life."</p><p>"The whole thing is kind of quite confusing, I think," she confessed.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwNhmpZ6vo2S7psPSaKKeoaKWeqy6yKCfraSVrsBuw8Sdm6Kml2KupMDRnqqsZZ2Wv7O1xKxko5mdmsBuvsign62nnmK2r3nLqK5mo5WueqSx0Z6kqKapYn9xfZJtbA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JamBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
