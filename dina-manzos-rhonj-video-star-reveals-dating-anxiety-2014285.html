After three seasons away from The Real Housewives of New Jersey, former series star <strong><a href=#>Dina Manzo</a></strong> is back with a vengeance in season six—and <strong><a href=#>Us Weekly</a></strong> has an early look at what kind of drama awaits her over the next few months.</p><p>As seen in this exclusive footage from the Bravo show, Manzo will try her hand at dating following her separation from her husband&nbsp;in February 2013. The two were married for seven years, so the Project Ladybug founder, 41, has been out of the game for quite some time.</p><p>“When I pictured myself 40-something, this was not what I was expecting,” she confesses. “The last time I had to get naked in front of a guy, I was 28 years old…There’s definitely anxiety around that.”</p><p><img decoding=async width=467 height=485 src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all" alt="Dina Manzo" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>There’s also some nervousness around her daughter Lexi’s departure for college. (Lexi, 17, is Manzo’s child from her first marriage.) “It’s the end of an era as a mom,” she says. “Now I just have to worry about my f—ed-up pets.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Manzo’s RHONJ comeback follows the departure of her estranged sister, <strong>Caroline</strong>, who left the series after five seasons last October. Announcing her return in previews for upcoming episodes, the interior decorator says cheekily, “The bitch is back, and if you don’t like it, you can kiss my ass.”</p><p>Watch the video above to see more, and tune in to the RHONJ preview special on Sunday, June 1, at 10 p.m. ET. The season premiere airs Sunday, July 13, at 8 p.m. ET.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaJuippFiuqK62aiqZqqYpLuredWim56nXajBor6Mq5yvnZGhwG6wwK2gp59dlru5tcStsGZqYGaBc4SUaA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JamBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
