We should add him to the list, along with Dylan McDermott and Rob Lowe, of dudes who pretty much look the same for twenty years. Anyway, I still find John Stamos attractive, in a swarthy-cute cheeseball sort of way. I can imagine meeting him at a bar and going home with him (or something like that). Apparently, a lot of women my age or much, much younger find themselves in the same situation. So what do they do after they’ve had sex with Uncle Jesse? They ask for a selfie. For real.</p><p>John Stamos opens up about his sex life in a book by “Glee” and “Family Guy” writer Ali Adler, “How To F--k a Woman.”</p><p>“A couple of women have wanted ‘selfies’ afterwards,” Stamos says, adding, “One girl really wanted my shirt, like a souvenir.”</p><p>Sounding a little weird, Stamos suavely notes: “It’s about listening, asking, talking ... I guess I do approach sex in a musical way. With me, it’s more rhythm than melody with a woman ... but it’s all listening ... With women, you have to listen to their bodies.”</p><p><a href=#>[From Page Six]</a></p><p>Let’s take this piece by piece. First, the selfie thing. That’s definitely more of a Generation Facebook thing, which means that Stamos is still getting 20-something ladies on the regular. Which means that for many of these young ladies, he is the Uncle Jesse of their childhood, but only “ironically” because they were only watching Full House in RERUNS. God, that makes me feel so old.</p><p>As for John’s music-sex-rhythm (that’s the name of Justin Timberlake’s new album), I don’t know. Do you think John is good in bed? Honestly… I think he’s probably pretty good. Is that crazy?</p><p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebitchy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/wenn22223366.jpg alt=wenn22223366 width=460 sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p>Photos courtesy of Fame/Flynet, Instagram, WENN.<br></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmirJOdxm%2BvzqZmbWloZYBxe8mon6eXo6murrvSmJiYm5%2Bqva2xvqidmK%2BforKvq8earZ6Xp5a7tbHDmKqepJaesrSrwJ%2BrnqqPqLK5ew%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JamBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
