For this reason, people try everything in their power to solve the problems that we go through. Every now and then, we will always face challenges that put us to the test. Sometimes, the problems that we go through are small, and we hardly notice them. It is until we are given solutions to our problems do we notice that what we are going through is a challenge. As much as we would like to say that we are tough enough to handle everything, sometimes getting a little help does not hurt.</p><p>As long as we are alive, we will always face challenges here and there. Sometimes, if not all the time, finding the solution to these problems proves to be a huge challenge. A solution might be just around the corner, but sometimes getting to it proves to be a big challenge.

She was able to sell eleven of them, and she received a lot of positive feedback. Making the actual product was not a challenge since her husband worked as a project manager at a factory.

They were actually amazed by the idea because she found the solution to a problem that everyone ignored. All she needed to set up her business idea quite well was about $50,000. Cheryl was quite lucky after the show that she received some mentorship from Daymond. Later on, Cheryl was also able to make a bigger version of the Spatty, which could be used for bigger containers such as paint cans in the garage and also some items in the kitchen.</p><h2>Evolution</h2><p>Cheryl’s brilliant idea received a lot of positive feedback, not only from the panel of entrepreneurs but also the viewers of the show. Shortly after the show, Cheryl received a lot of requests from fans who wanted to have the product. Cheryl went on to have a lot of success in the coming years.
