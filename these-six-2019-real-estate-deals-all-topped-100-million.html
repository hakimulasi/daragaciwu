From a penthouse in Manhattan, to mansions in Palm Beach and Los Angeles, these mega deals made the news. In Palm Beach, in particular, a number of very high-priced deals sparked debate over the number of wealthy New Yorkers moving to Florida as a result of the 2017 change in federal tax law. A number of $100 million-plus deals in Los Angeles put emphasis on the ultra-high-end real estate on the West Coast.</p><p>It almost goes without saying at this point that the highest price paid for a home in 2019 was hedge fund manager Ken Griffin's $238 million purchase of a penthouse on Manhattan's billionaire's row. Griffin has been on a real estate buying spree for a number of years now. In fact, Griffin had two properties on the list of the 10 most expensive this year. He also paid $99.1 million for a Palm Beach property, the eighth highest-priced real estate deal of the year.</p><p>Prior to 2019, the most $100 million-plus deals in one year was three in both 2014 and 2016. In 2019 there were six $100 million-plus deals. Three of the deals were in Los Angeles, two in Palm Beach, and one in New York City.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-291319 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-900x/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/GettyImages-1087945056.jpg alt width=900 height=587 sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-291319 class=wp-caption-text>220 Central Park South (TIMOTHY A.
