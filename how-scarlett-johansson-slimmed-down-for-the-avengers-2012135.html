Between slipping into a skintight costume and unveiling some serious moves against Loki's army, this wasn't a character the star, 27, rolled out of bed for. To prep for the physically demanding role, she worked for almost two months with trainer Bobby Strom and her stunt double Heidi Moneymaker. Keep reading to see how the blonde beauty got herself in svelte shape for the role.</p><p><a href=#>PHOTOS: More actresses who have slimmed down for a role</a><strong></strong></p><p><strong>The power of circuits</strong>: Strom, <a href=#>who also trained Johansson during Iron Man 2</a>, says he used <a href=#>a similar training program</a> for her reprisal of this role: 90-minute circuit workouts, multiple times per week. The goal was to get her ready for those explosive on-screen movements. Strom kept things varied through the use of dumbbells, resistance bands, medicine balls, and TRX; workouts were built around sets of 20, with 25 to 30 reps of each exercise. Strom also had the star doing running intervals, both in and out of the gym. Get in superhero shape like Johansson did by finishing our <a href=#>full-body circuit workout with weights</a>.<strong></strong></p><strong></strong><p><strong>Combative training</strong>: One of the first scenes in <strong>The Avengers</strong> shows Johansson fighting off multiple members of the Russian mob, something which <a href=#>Moneymaker helped her prepare for</a>. A longtime stunt double in the industry, Moneymaker says she and the actress had about six weeks to prepare for the various fight scenes in the movie, using elements of mixed martial arts (MMA) and "hand-to-hand combat and weapons training." Speaking of the role, Johansson told Vogue, "You get beat up a lot," she says. "It's painful." Get a little MMA into your own life by doing this <a href=#>video workout with former Biggest Loser trainer Brett Hoebel</a>.</p><p><strong>An (almost) vegan diet</strong>: The actress arrived on set already following a healthy diet plan, one that Strom describes as "mostly vegan." He says she focused on eating several small meals each day. As was the case during Iron Man 2, there was a lot of oatmeal, fresh fruits and veggies, salads, and lean proteins.</p><p><strong>Related Links:</strong></p><p><a href=#>PHOTOS: How Jennifer Lawrence transformed into Katniss Everdeen</a></p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p><a href=#>PHOTOS: Jessica Biel, Minka Kelly, and stars who love to work out</a></p><p><a href=#>PHOTOS: How Jessica Alba stays healthy and fit</a></p><p><a href=#>PHOTOS: Reese, Heidi, and more stars who love running</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwNhmmaicqWS7psPSaJ%2Bor12osKK%2By56rrWWapLWiutKspqdlo6G2rrnEnWSdp6ejeqe70WaroZ1dlsOmusaeqaxlYmV%2Bc32Sbg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JamBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
