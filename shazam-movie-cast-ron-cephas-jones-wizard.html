Even with&nbsp;rumors and speculation&nbsp;abuzz around the world of DC Films - ranging from the&nbsp;status of <a href=#>Flashpoint</a> and the uncertain casting for&nbsp;<a href=#>The Batman</a>&nbsp;-&nbsp;Warner Bros. Pictures and DC's Shazam! comic book adaptation is moving steadily through the final stages of pre-production.&nbsp;Annabelle: Creation&nbsp;director David F. Sandberg is overseeing the operation, with a cast that includes actors <a href=#>Zachary Levi</a> and <a href=#>Asher Angel</a>, along with <a href=#>Mark Strong</a>&nbsp;as the main villain. Despite the recent&nbsp;<a href=#>shake-up within Warner Bros. and DC Films</a>, production on&nbsp;Shazam!&nbsp;remains&nbsp;on track to start any day now.</p><p>Angel will portray Billy Batson, a young teenage boy who eventually gains the power to transform into the adult superhero Shazam (or Captain Marvel), played by Levi. With most of these key roles being cast, one&nbsp;casting announcement has been anticipated by those familiar with the hero's origin. The Wizard, also named Shazam in the comic books, is an essential character that magically grants Batson with mythical powers that transform him into the famous superhero. With the beginning of production to begin (alarmingly) soon, the role of the Wizard in Sandberg's film has been cast.</p><p><strong class=featured-text>Related: <a href=#>Mark Strong Has 'Unfinished Business' With DC</a></strong></p><p>Per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Wrap</a>, actor&nbsp;Ron Cephas Jones will be taking the part. Jones is perhaps best known for his role in <a href=#>This is Us</a>, playing William "Shakespeare" Hill, the biological father of Sterling K. Brown's character, Randall. For this role, Jones was nominated for the Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama Series Primetime Emmy Award. Jones has also appeared on other prestige dramas, including <a href=#>The Get Down</a> and <a href=#>Mr. Robot</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.srcdn.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Shazam-DC-Comics-Wizard.jpg><p>Comic book movie/television show fans may also recognize Jones for his role as&nbsp;Bobby Fish from <a href=#>Marvel's Luke Cage</a>, a regular at Pop's Barber Shop and one of the mentor figures of Cage. With the addition of Shazam! to his resume, the Emmy-nominated actor sure is strengthening his superhero credentials.</p><p>The presence of the Wizard supports the notion that <strong>Shazam!</strong> will be an origin story for the titular superhero, with similar films from both Marvel and DC having featured some sort of elder or mentor figure. With Jones already having some experience in this kind of role through Luke Cage, and gaining some larger recognition from the recent critical hit This is Us, the actor certainly marks off all the checkboxes for a big role in an upcoming superhero blockbuster.</p><p><strong class=featured-text>MORE: <a href=#>Shazam!
