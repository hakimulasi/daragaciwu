Media sources stated that Spain’s football boss, Luis Rubiales, will resign over the kiss he planted on forward Jenni Hermoso’s lips during the Women’s World Cup medal presentation on Sunday after days of controversy in Spain and around the world.</p><p>But rather than announcing his resignation at a last-minute football federation meeting on Friday, he shocked many Spaniards by adamantly stating “I will not resign” five times in a rambling speech that attacked “false feminism,” attempted to paint himself as a victim, and recast the kiss as “a peck.”</p><p>The federation, which has just six women among its 140 members, was instructed by the Spanish government to act immediately if Rubiales did not comply with its earlier promise to take action against him.</p><p>Yolanda Daz, Spain’s acting labor minister and second deputy prime minister, declared on social media that “what we saw today at the federation’s assembly is unacceptable.” “The government must take immediate action because chauvinistic behavior is no longer tolerated. Rubiales is unable to remain in the role.</p><p>Rafael del Amo, who managed women’s football, and a few other high-ranking federation officials who represented the organization in various parts of the nation are among those who reportedly announced their resignations late on Friday.</p><p>However, Jorge Vilda, the head coach of the Spanish women’s national team, and Luis de la Fuente, the head coach of the Spanish men’s national team, both enthusiastically applauded Rubiales earlier for his attack on feminism.</p><p>The 46-year-old had other plans as the media prepared stories on Rubiales’ resignation. He promised the federation’s members, who hailed his audacity with waves of loud applause and a standing ovation, “I will fight this to the end.”</p><p>He expressed his sincere regret for the “unfortunate gesture” of clutching his crotch during La Roja’s World Cup victory, but he insisted that the kiss that threatened to detract from the team’s accomplishments had been consensual.</p><p>Hermoso stated on a live stream that she “didn’t like it” shortly after the kiss, which was given on stage at the post-match ceremony.</p><p>Irene Montero, who was among the first to refer to the kiss as a “form of sexual violence,” the acting minister of equality, said on social media on Friday that the National Sports Council and Spain’s Public Prosecutor would take appropriate measures. “Jenni Hermoso, you are not alone now more than ever.”</p><p>Members of the World Cup-winning team were even more outraged after Rubiales’ answer on Friday. On social media, the center back Irene Paredes posted: “I’m with you Jenni Hermoso. The event was seen by everyone. You were the hapless one.</p><p>“There are limits that cannot be crossed and this cannot be tolerated,” wrote the midfielder Aitana Bonmat. Iker Casillas, a former custodian for Spain’s men, called the scenario embarrassing. We ought to have talked about our female players and the delight they brought us all over the past five days! On X, he wrote, “About how happy we are that they granted us a title that we didn’t have in women’s football.</p><p>Real Betis striker Borja Iglesias declared he would not play for Spain’s national team again until conditions improved. He said that he believed Friday’s events had not “represented him as a football player and person,” saying, “I’m sad and disappointed.”</p><p>While many had anticipated that this drama would conclude on Friday, the outpouring of support for Hermoso and condemnation of Rubiales signaled that they were willing to stand their ground for what might be a protracted battle.</p><p>People demanded change, according to Victor Francos, Spain’s secretary of sports and president of the National Sports Council, on Friday. This might be Spanish football’s equivalent of the #MeToo movement.</p><p>According to Rubiales, the recent events were part of a “social assassination” carried out in part by “false feminists, one of the scourges of this country.”</p><p>Rubiales’ intransigence did not surprise Beatriz Lvarez, the president of Spain’s women’s league, who characterized him as a person whose “ego is above his dignity.”</p><p>According to Lvarez, “What surprises and scandalises me are his words.” Every time he speaks, he demonstrates his true character.</p><p>Assuring that “acts like the ones we witnessed don’t go unpunished, are sanctioned, and that pertinent measures are adopted to protect the soccer players against actions that are unacceptable,” Hermoso’s union, Futpro, which the footballer has claimed is representing her interests in the case, said.</p><p>Sevilla, the winners of the Europa League, declared on Friday that they denounced and rejected Rubiales’ treatment of Hermoso as well as the justification he provided before the federation meeting. “Rubiales should resign from his position as the highest representative of Spanish football,” the statement concluded.</p><p>In a statement, FC Barcelona noted that Rubiales’ attitude during the World Cup celebration was “totally inappropriate and unfortunate” but did not address the speech from Friday.</p><p>Real Madrid spoke as well, stating that the club “fully supports” the National Sports Council’s choice to put the matter before a tribunal right away in an effort to get Rubiales dismissed.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"></figure><p><strong>Also Read :</strong></p><ul><li><a href=#>Denise Rutkowski Wiki, Wikipedia, Facebook, Today, Net Worth</a></li><li><a href=#>Chip Gaines Ethnicity, Wikipedia, Wiki, Net Worth, Real Name, Age, Kids, Height, Parents</a></li><li><a href=#>Sunny Sandler Instagram, Wikipedia, Height, Parents, Age, Net Worth, Birthday</a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmignpe0tnrNnqtopKWewG6%2B1JugmqSVqHpzew%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JamBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
