The "Blank Space" singer is totally smitten with the Scottish hunk, and now, the singer's cats are putting two paws up in approval, too. "[Taylor's] over the moon," Olympic figure skater <strong>Gracie Gold</strong>, one of Swift's BFFs, told <a href=#><strong>Us Weekly</strong></a> at the July 16 Kids<strong>'</strong> Choice Sports awards in Los Angeles."Even her cats are happy! And if her cats are happy, she's happy."</p><p>As Gold told <strong>Us</strong>, Harris, 31, is no doubt hip to the fact that doting on Olivia and Meredith will help him earn more points from girlfriend Swift, 25. "They're not too high maintenance but they're spoiled. They are adorable," Gold said of the felines Swift named in honor of her favorite TV heroines Olivia Benson (Law & Order: SVU's <a href=#><strong>Mariska Hargitay</strong></a>), and Meredith Grey (Grey's Anatomy's <a href=#><strong>Ellen Pompeo</strong></a>).</p><p>Cat chat aside, Gold told <strong>Us</strong> she considers Swift's deejay beau to be a "real sweetheart."</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>On Friday, July 17, Harris himself shared just <a href=#>what it is that makes him click</a> with Swift. "It's boxes I didn't even know existed, she ticks," Harris told the UK's HITS Radio of Swift's impressive range of talents. "It's really ridiculous… She's generally an incredible cook and human being."</p><p>Named Forbes' highest-paid 2015 couple, Harris and Swift realize that they're fortunate to do what many other young couples can't. "The luxury is we can both travel very easily," he mused to KISS FM UK. "I think that's a reason that it works so well… It's really not hard to see each other on a regular basis."</p><p>"It's going absolutely fantastic," he summed up, nothing that the attention doesn't necessarily bother him. "For me, it could be a lot worse, and I'd still be like insanely happy with her. So, I'm good with it."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwNhmpZ6vo2S7psPSaJ6rmZOesm6zzqWbZquRrsBusdWepWaska65sL6MrK6inqSoeqSt06xkmqqVYrWivM%2ByZLChpJ16pK3Lr6CnZZiWv7O10mZpaWllZoR4</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JamBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
