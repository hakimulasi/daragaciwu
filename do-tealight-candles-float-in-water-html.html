Therefore, when submerged in water, it floats! Not every candle, on the other hand, can float! These candles are often created in a spherical form, which enables them to float equally wherever they are put on a table or other surface.</p><p></p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-147 data-inserter-version=2></span><h3>Also, why do floating candles rise in the water as they burn, rather than sinking?</h3><p>&nbsp;The physical element is that the candle warms and expands the air around it. This momentarily prevents the loss of oxygen from occurring, and the water level remains low. When the oxygen supply is gone, the candle is extinguished and the air becomes cooler. The volume of the air decreases, while the volume of the water increases.</p><p></p><h3>As a result, can LED tea lights be submerged in water?</h3><p>It is possible to use these little LED lights almost anyplace, even underwater.
