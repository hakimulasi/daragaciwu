Their steamy time together was cut short at the end of the season after Rowland told Gabby’s husband about the betrayal, but he did return for future guest appearances.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Like his former costar, Metcalfe was equally enthused to reunite on Sunday at the LG Fam-to-Table Series: ProBake Edition event in L.A.’s Culver City neighborhood. “So great seeing #oneofMYfavoritepeople yesterday!” Metcalfe, 36, wrote on Instagram, alongside a pic with Longoria and his girlfriend,<strong> Cara Santana</strong>. “Thanks for having us.”</p><p>In real life, Longoria said she likes it when her boyfriend, Jose Antonio Baston, eats healthy. Speaking to <strong>Us</strong> at the same event, the actress said the businessman is a big fan of her cooking. “Everything. He likes my breakfasts,” she boasted. “I change it up. He’s a healthy eater, so I usually do like a rice cake, breakfast sandwich. Like a rice cake with avocado with a fried egg.”</p><p>She also shared with Us what she looks for in a significant other. “I love anybody who cares for an animal, because I think animals really are high maintenance,” Longoria said on Sunday. “If there’s a guy who’s actually responsible for another being that’s a good sign, that he’s somewhat normal.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwNhmpZ6vo2S7psPSaJyvmV2hvK%2BzzqugmmWimsKvtdOeqmavmam1brDErKeeqpGpsm60zq6qnq%2BZq7K0ecKoqq2ZomK3pr%2FSnmSmnaSYrq2yxGZpaWllZ4F5</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JamBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
