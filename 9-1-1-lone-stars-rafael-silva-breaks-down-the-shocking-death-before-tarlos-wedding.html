But when Gabriel later answered the door, he was shot directly in the chest by a masked assailant.&nbsp;</p><p id=eAKLpHUNe_ data-wc=24>"Our final scene together was when Carlos asked Gabriel to be his best man," <a class=hm-link href=# rel=noopener>Rafael shared with HELLO! during a photoshoot in Los Angeles.&nbsp;</a></p><p id=eKz3P90lCX data-wc=75>"It was on location, in Pomona, and we just sat down just by ourselves, the only two there, and I thanked Gabriel for playing my father, and having such a presence in my life not just as a person, but also as an actor. It was an emotional moment because I genuinely felt like there was a loss there. You always have to serve the story but this is going to change Carlos' life forever."&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/15e17d1f9273-rafa-hello.jpg><p id=ehDlFwuQzY3 data-wc=15><strong>Exclusive: <a class=hm-link href=#>9-1-1: Lone Star's Ronen Rubinstein on life after coming out and finding his 'calling'</a></strong></p><p id=eHyjljA6pXS data-wc=14><strong data-gid=e44-gXSpimt>Exclusive:<a class=hm-link href=#>&nbsp;9-1-1's Oliver Stark opens up about vulnerability and why it's okay to cry</a></strong></p><p id=eNlufALyS_ data-wc=33>"It's a blessing to be given these storylines," Rafael continued, "because it's not every day that you get a story like this with juicy scenes where you have to focus and step up.&nbsp;</p><p id=eWLhV0kGf1 data-wc=52>"This is Carlos going through this, but this is equally Rafael having to go through this storyline and for somebody else it may just be another day on set but, no one is tied to Gabriel as I am. I had to own that and I had to honor that as well.&nbsp;</p><p id=eVI-zT5zag data-wc=50>"I wanted the audience to know how much they have a history together, to see this life they have together even though we have not physically seen any of those things.

"I said, 'I had that thought last night because that's the only thing that can top being held hostage,' and then obviously that immediately broke my heart to have the confirmation because Benito is a fantastic actor and I'm only as good as the person in front of me. Whenever I was with him I felt I had to step up."&nbsp;</p><p id=eWuhpwEI2I data-wc=14><a class=hm-link href=# rel=noopener>Exclusive: 9-1-1: Lone Star's Ronen Rubinstein weds Jessica Parker Kennedy in intimate farm wedding</a></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/cbadbbaccd56-ronen-rafa-hello.jpg><p id=eQ_oAMIAyr data-wc=77>season four has given Rafael ample screen time, after three seasons in which many fans complained that he had been relegated to the background, and Rafael acknowledges that although he will always take more stories, it's "just a blessing to be employed as an actor because there are a lot of talented actors out there that do not get a chance to get into the room to audition because they don't even have the representation".&nbsp;</p><p id=eKcaD4huYM data-wc=21>"If they keep giving me more storylines to play with, I'm going to take them with no questions asked," he concluded.&nbsp;</p><p id=e2lXT8h42b data-wc=27>"However I will question the integrity of it, and ask, 'Is it aligned with my character?'
