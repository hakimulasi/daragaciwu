Below Deck franchise stars <strong>Rhylee Gerber, Aesha Scott </strong>and<a href=#><strong> Captain Sandy Yawn</strong></a> will pop up during the group’s trip too, per Wednesday’s press release.</p><p>“This is a classic social experiment. No one knows what is going to happen. Forces combine [and] boom,” Kyle teases as glimpses of the upcoming drama played out on screen.</p><p>Scroll on for the biggest romantic revelations from the Winter House season 3 trailer:</p><h3>Schwartz’s New Bromance</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Breaking-Down-the-Winter-House-Season-3-Crossover-Hookups-Tom.jpg><p>Schwartz joined season 3 of Winter House in the aftermath of <a href=#><strong>Tom Sandoval</strong></a>‘s cheating scandal with <a href=#><strong>Raquel Leviss</strong></a>. In the sneak peek, Schwartz was seen bonding with new friend — and roommate — Alex.</p><p>Schwartz <a href=#>was meant to return to the Bravo spinoff show</a> with Sandoval in tow.</p><p>“I think he wanted to go film Winter House but still be the good guy,” <a href=#><strong>Ariana Madix</strong></a>, who <a href=#>ended things with Sandoval due to his affair</a>, said during a May appearance on Watch What Happens Live With Andy Cohen.</p><h3>Schwartz and His New Katie</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Breaking-Down-the-Winter-House-Season-3-Crossover-Hookups-Tom-2.jpg><p>The TomTom co-owner not only made some new friends — he also seemingly formed a connection with Below Deck Med star Katie.</p><p>“Katie is so hot but I can never hook up with someone named Katie,” Schwartz, who announced his split from <a href=#><strong>Katie Maloney</strong></a> in March 2022 after six years of marriage, explained. “This is the universe f—king with me. It’s a good joke.”</p><p>The trailer included a scene of Schwartz <a href=#>kissing the chief stew before they shut the door</a> behind them.</p><h3>Kory’s Flirtation With Malia and Jordan</h3><p>After hooking up with Sam during season 7 of Summer House, Kory <a href=#>entered the Winter House with an open mind</a>. Malia and Jordan subsequently had some questions for Kory about his relationship status as Sam is set to make an appearance in the cabin.</p><p>“We haven’t made it exclusive. I don’t know [if we will],” Kory told Malia as footage of him and the bosun getting close aired.</p><p>(Kory and Sam confirmed at the Summer House season 7 reunion in May, <a href=#>filmed after Winter House, that they are now official.)</a></p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><h3>Alex Ends Up in Awkward Love Triangle With Danielle and Jordan</h3><p>Danielle’s split from <strong>Robert Sieber</strong> came as a surprise to Summer House fans after season 7. On Winter House season 3, <a href=#>her connection with Below Deck’s Alex</a> appeared to be fleeting though since he was also seen flirting with Summer House: MV’s Jordan and a random girl at a party.</p><h3>Kyle and Amanda’s Potential Pregnancy</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Breaking-Down-the-Winter-House-Season-3-Crossover-Hookups-Kyle-Amanda.jpg><p>After discussing their fertility issues on and off screen, Amanda <a href=#>was seen taking a pregnancy test</a> while at the cabin. Although the trailer didn’t reveal the results, season 3 was filmed in March 2023 so the response is presumably that she isn’t pregnant.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaK6ipqSav260zq6qnmWjmq60u81mamasopa2rbHRZquemaOawG64zq%2BcZqyinq6vs8ueqmaoopq0r63NnLBmrJWowXA%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JamBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
