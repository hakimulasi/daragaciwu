In the 1960s, Gene Roddenberry invented Star Trek, and Star Trek: The Original Series aired on NBC from 1966 to 1969 for three seasons. Star Wars, which George Lucas created, broke box office records in 1977. Due to the success of Star Wars, Star Trek also started a film series in 1979 with Star Trek: The Motion Picture.</p><p>Star Wars and Star Trek have amassed many admirers over the years as the properties have dominated television and film. After George Lucas’ Original and Prequel Trilogies, Disney acquired Star Wars in 2012, resulting in the release of five further Star Wars movies as well as popular animated programmes like Star Wars: The Clone Wars and Disney+ series like The Mandalorian. Ten TV shows have been based on Star Trek, five of which are currently available to stream on Paramount+. 13 Star Trek motion pictures have also been released between 1979 and 2016. As a result, numerous actors have alternated between the Star Trek universe and the galaxy from a long time ago and far, far away in Star Wars.</p><p class=toc_title>Table Of Content</p><ul class=toc_list><li><a href=#><span class="toc_number toc_depth_1">1</span> Brent Spiner</a></li><li><a href=#><span class="toc_number toc_depth_1">2</span> Brian George</a></li><li><a href=#><span class="toc_number toc_depth_1">3</span> Christina Chong</a></li><li><a href=#><span class="toc_number toc_depth_1">4</span> Clive Revill</a></li><li><a href=#><span class="toc_number toc_depth_1">5</span> David Birney</a></li><li><a href=#><span class="toc_number toc_depth_1">6</span> Deep Roy</a></li><li><a href=#><span class="toc_number toc_depth_1">7</span> Ed Begley, Jr.</a></li><li><a href=#><span class="toc_number toc_depth_1">8</span> Ethan Phillips</a></li><li><a href=#><span class="toc_number toc_depth_1">9</span> Felix Silla</a></li><li><a href=#><span class="toc_number toc_depth_1">10</span> Fionnula Flanagan</a></li><li><a href=#><span class="toc_number toc_depth_1">11</span> Fred Tatasciore</a></li><li><a href=#><span class="toc_number toc_depth_1">12</span> George Coe</a></li><li><a href=#><span class="toc_number toc_depth_1">13</span> George Takei</a></li><li><a href=#><span class="toc_number toc_depth_1">14</span> Greg Grunberg</a></li><li><a href=#><span class="toc_number toc_depth_1">15</span> Ian Abercrombie</a></li><li><a href=#><span class="toc_number toc_depth_1">16</span> J.J.
