She was a friend to everyone at&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener>Ignite Fights</a>&nbsp;and I can only imagine how many more. She was the definition of someone who lit up a room and gone far , far too soon, I can’t imagine with her work ethic and talent what she would have accomplished.”</p><p>Shalie Lipp grew up in northwestern MInnesota where she excelled at track and field and gymnastics in the communities of Perham and Breckenridge.</p><p>The Whapeton Daily News&nbsp;reports that Lipp had only recently returned from training in Thailand, where she’d spent most of the month of April honing her mixed martial arts training at various academies in southeast Asia. While still officially an amateur in the fighting ranks, Lipp was in heavy training as a member of the Academy of Combat Arts in Fargo, a facility responsible for training athletes who have fought in the Bellator series, considered a precursor for the UFC.</p><p>Thanks for reading from <a href=# rel=noopener>Ghsplash</a> a news publishing website from Ghana.
