In fact, the 27-year-old singer is repping his relationship with <a href=#><strong>Olivia Wilde</strong> </a>thanks to his <a href=#>A+ accessory game</a>.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1>“Jewelry was always going to be a part of Harry’s onstage look when he planned this tour, but his relationship with Olivia has turned this costuming idea into a genuine shared passion,” a source exclusively shared with Us Weekly.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1>The 37-year-old actress actually gifts the singer baubles to wear while he’s performing. “He’s wearing pieces on stage that she only gave him recently and he’s traveling with a trunk load of the stuff. He just isn’t shy about how much he loves that old rock and roll, jewelry-encrusted look,” the insider added.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1>In addition to jewelry, the “Watermelon Sugar” singer has been sending fans crazy with his on-stage outfits, which consist of fringe vests, wide-leg trousers and blouses designed largely by Gucci.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1>But it was Wilde who prompted a viral TikTok earlier this month, after an eagle-eyed fan picked up on the fact that the Don’t Worry Darling actress wore a piece of jewelry from her beau’s collection to the Gucci Love Parade in Los Angeles.</p><p class=p1>The Booksmart director, who sat front-row at the fashion show, paired her lace bralette, bustier and pencil skirt with a gold cross pendant on a dainty chain. The latter appears to be the same piece — or a very similar one — to a necklace Styles has been spotted wearing on multiple occasions.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1>Wilde doesn’t just wear Styles’ jewelry though. She’s also <a href=#>a fan of his merch</a>. In October, the star stepped out in a “Treat People With Kindness” hoodie from the singer’s line. The week prior, she also carried his Love On Tour tote bag while out and about in Los Angeles.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p1>The pair’s romance first made headlines in January, when they were spotted holding hands at Styles’ manger’s wedding, just two months after she split from former fiancé <a href=#><strong>Jason Sudeikis</strong></a>.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1>At the time, a source exclusively told Us that the two formed a connection while on set of Don’t Worry Darling. “Harry and Olivia had chemistry almost instantaneously on set,” the insider said. “It was only a matter of time before they got together.”<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmrKypoba0tI6nnLCrX52us77YZqqtsZyawG60wKxkm52Vo3q4scCroKefXZy2p8DSZp2rp51ivK211aKYZq%2BZobGmec6nZKyskZyycA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JamBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
