And it was clear in photos how smitten they remain of each other.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=1 class="css-1nd4gv7 et3p2gv0">The married couple and parents of two dressed sharply for the event, of course. Meester debuted blunt bangs while wearing a brown velvet sleeveless dress adorned with flower embroidery. She accessorized with Bondeye jewelry. Brody kept his look classy but modern in a dark green Paul Smith suit.</p><img alt='adam brody and leighton meester at "fleishman is in trouble" new york premiere' title='Adam Brody and Leighton Meester at "Fleishman Is In Trouble" New York Premiere' width=3000 height=4500 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/adam-brody-leighton-meester-gettyimages-1667928686.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-wudbrp e6iqukd2">Roy Rochlin</span><span class="css-efig6y e6iqukd0">//</span><span class="css-wudbrp e6iqukd1">Getty Images</span></p><img alt='adam brody and leighton meester at "fleishman is in trouble" new york premiere' title='Adam Brody and Leighton Meester at "Fleishman Is In Trouble" New York Premiere' width=4000 height=2666 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/adam-brody-and-leighton-meester-attend-fxs-fleishman-is-in-news-photo-1667927056.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-wudbrp e6iqukd2">Noam Galai</span><span class="css-efig6y e6iqukd0">//</span><span class="css-wudbrp e6iqukd1">Getty Images</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="css-1nd4gv7 et3p2gv0">Brody <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.elle.com/culture/celebrities/a35980736/adam-brody-leighton-meester-love-story-interview/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="spoke in March 2021" class="body-link css-d2yypp et3p2gv0">spoke in March 2021</a> about how he met Meester and ultimately fell in love with her. “Literally the first time we met, that whole cast [Gossip Girl] was eating at Canter’s, and I lived at Canter’s for like my entire 20s. And I was leaving, and he [The OC and Gossip Girl producer Josh Schwartz] introduced all of us.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 et3p2gv0">The two eventually worked together on 2011 film The Oranges, but Brody hadn’t been single at the time. “We did this movie together,” he said. “I was seeing someone at the time... So we met kind of through mutual work friends off and on. And then we didn’t get together [until] about a year after that movie, when I was single.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 et3p2gv0">“I was very attracted to her from jump. She’s a heavenly creature,” he continued. “I thought she was gorgeous. And even when we did the movie, there was chemistry there, but I was seeing someone. But I had no idea whether she was a good person or not. And, in fact, kind of assumed she probably wasn’t for like the first handful of years that I didn’t know her, just because, I don’t know, Gossip Girl.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 et3p2gv0">“Not that I tagged all actresses with that or anything—I didn’t,” he clarified. “And I like to date actors. I never believe that stigma. Why [wouldn’t an actor want to date an actress]? Too beautiful and smart?”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 et3p2gv0">When he started dating Meester though, he came to see how incredible she was over time. “I was like, ‘Oh, she’s cool.’ But I still didn’t know, and that continued even to when we first started dating…and come to find out she’s literally like Joan of Arc,” he said. “She is the strongest, best person I know. She is my moral compass and North Star, and I just can’t say enough good things about her character. It’s crazy. She’s never been rude to like a single person in her life, except—and I give her credit for this—paparazzi, where I’m too self-conscious. I wouldn’t say ‘rude,’ but, like, people will try to get her to sign some sexy old photo or something that aren’t fans but they pretend to be fans...it’s sort of a bottom feeding thing...she has no problem being like, ‘You can hate me. I don’t care.’”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7prjLnmWcp51ksLa4066pnmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2SudX2YaWdsaGZkuaa1xqGrqKZdorKmv9OeqWaZlJa6bq7RqJuyZZahsqq%2Fx6aYp2WZqHqquoytqaitkqGybrzRnqSinaKaerG0zq2mrGc%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JamBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
