Well, the streamer has already provided a solid answer to that question, stating that he cannot speak anything else. Aside from the little Spanish that he throws around, Dr Disrespect may have studied Spanish back in the day. It is still not sure whether the streamer is fluent in this language, but surely he has some grasp over it.</p><p>In the latest video shared on his YouTube channel, Doc can be seen reading Spanish subtitles of the latest FromSoftware game, ‘Elden Ring’.
