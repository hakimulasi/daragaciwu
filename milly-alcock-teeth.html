Here is what people have been saying about her teeth on the internet.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>1. Something weird about her teeth</h2><p>On a <a href=# data-type=URL data-id=https://www.reddit.com/r/VindictaRateCelebs/comments/x6jimj/milly_alcock/ rel="noreferrer noopener">Reddit thread</a> created on September 5, 2022, fans discussed many things about the rising actress. And seeing that opportunity, some even talked about her teeth.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>One fan, in particular, wrote that there is something really weird about Alcock’s “teeth/mouth (overbite?).” “And she looks like she’s 12 without a lot of makeup. I would say a 5, a 6.5 (at most) with makeup and clothes that show she’s not a kid, lol,” they added.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>2. A mathematical angle</h2><p>Another Reddit user applied a mathematical view to the comment mentioned above.</p><p>They said Alcock’s teeth come out “like a 45 angle rather than straight up and down,” making her mouth look weird. “But she’s very unique and an amazing actor,” the Redditor later praised the actress.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>3. One fan rated Milly Alcock a two due to her teeth</h2><p>After going down on the same Reddit thread’s comments, one fan rated Alcock a “7-7.5” as she “has a very youthful look, definitely on the cute/ethereal side.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/glamourbuff.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Redditor-rating-Milly-Alcock-based-on-her-teeth.jpg><p class="has-text-align-center has-small-font-size">A Redditor rating Milly Alcock based on her teeth (Photo: Reddit)</p><p>However, another Reddit user seemed to completely disagree as they said, “That’s crazy lol,” and added, “Teeth and lips make her 2.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>4. Fan claims Milly Alcock isn’t very attractive</h2><p>On August 19, 2022, <a href=# data-type=URL data-id=https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-11126935/House-Dragon-star-Milly-Alcock-admits-misses-wearing-white-blonde-wig.html rel="noreferrer noopener">Daily Mail</a> published an article on Alcock where the outlet reported the actress admitting to missing wearing her white blonde wig on the sets of <a href=# data-type=URL data-id=https://glamourbuff.com/tag/house-of-the-dragon/ rel="noreferrer noopener">House of the Dragon</a>, even though it took 90 minutes to wear the wig appropriately.</p><p>And while the article was there, a netizen took to the comment section of that piece to make their say on Alcock’s teeth. They wrote, “Actress Milly with bad teeth overbite and puggy nose is not very attractive. Couldn’t they find a better-looking girl for that role?”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>5. Milly Alcock has pointy teeth</h2><p>Stepping away from the Reddit thread, we now come to Twitter, where people often converse about different topics.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><p lang=en dir=ltr>something about milly alcock's pointy teeth</p>— just a fan of thermodynamics (@horrorIesbian) <a href=# rel=noopener>September 21, 2022</a></figure><p>On September 22, 2022, one Twitter user took to their Twitter handle to do the same about Alcock’s teeth and mentioned that she has “pointy teeth.” The original tweet read, “something about Milly Alcock’s pointy teeth.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>6. Mesmerized by Milly Alcock’s mouth</h2><p>Before this, we mentioned netizens talking negatively about Milly Alcock’s teeth. But that doesn’t seem to be the case for a Twitter user. In fact, they are mesmerized by it.</p><p>On August 26, 2022, a Twitteratti took to their handle to state that Alcock has “officially made horsey teeth attractive.” “I’ve never been so confusingly mesmerized by someone’s mouth…” they added.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Milly Alcock has officially made horsey teeth attractive.
