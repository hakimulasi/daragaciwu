Suspecting it might be a quake, he turned on his police radio and heard numerous calls coming into 911 dispatch from residents.</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>“We received voluminous amounts of 911 calls. It was literally one call after another,” he said. “It shook my house. It wasn’t a rattle, I thought something hit the house. A lot of people were waking up.”</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>Bernabei said he had not heard of any reports of damage because of the quake. He said Illinois valley regional dispatch based in Peru and which covers several north-central Illinois communities received many dozens of calls from residents who felt the quake.</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>Randy Simpson, a dispatcher for Illinois valley regional dispatch center, said dispatchers on duty at the time received numerous calls from people who felt the ground shaking or the noise of their homes rattling. There were no reports of damage, he said.</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>Simpson, who lives in Mendota about 16 miles north of Standard, said he was up watching TV and did not feel the quake. But a friend who lives in the same community texted him to say he had just felt an earthquake and that his house shook.</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>“He said, ‘Did you feel that?’ And I was like ‘Feel what?’” Simpson said.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEoKyaqpSerq96wqikaK2jYrumw9JoaWlqY2S7sMKOamxonZGnwam91JqinmWepL%2B1tMSrpWahnKG2r7vIrGSsrJGjsaK%2Bww%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JamBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
