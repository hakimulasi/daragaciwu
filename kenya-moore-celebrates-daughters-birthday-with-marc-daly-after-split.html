My sole concern and focus is and will always be my daughter, Brooklyn, my miracle baby. She was made in love and true commitment. I ask for our privacy to be respected moving forward.”</p><p>The following month, Moore told Us that she isn’t legally single “yet” and opened up about parenting with Daly. “I’ve had a husband who is helping me raise our child together and I’m thankful that he was in our lives consistently for a great period of time since Brooklyn was born,” the reality star said.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>The toddler, who <a href=#>arrived in November 2018</a>, is already talking, the Game, Get Some author went on to tell Us in October. “<a href=#>[Her first word] was neighborhood, but no one believes me</a>,” she revealed. “I heard it.

Those kinds of worries.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8r7HWrGaknZ6urm65zqipnmWTmrmmrtGaq56rXZmutrPHrZyrq12XtrPAx52YsmWnnsGpecyaqZxllJa5unnAn6ueql2ova2102g%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JamBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
