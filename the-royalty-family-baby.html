Here’s everything we know about the new addition.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram</a></figure><p>As their name implies, The Royalty Family are pretty much kings, queens, and princes in the <a href=#><u>YouTube</u></a> world. With nearly 8.5 million subscribers and more than a billion views to date, the family’s motto is that everyone can be royalty.&nbsp;</p><p>To introduce themselves to fans, they say, “We are a modern blended family based in Los Angeles that love to entertain you. We believe in family, fun, love and are passionate about fashion, comedy and culture.”</p><p>Since starting up their channel in April 2017, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Royalty Family</a> consisted of Andrea Espada, Ali Espada, and Ferran Espada — or <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>King Ferran</u></a>, as he’s better known on social media — as well as Princesa and Gucci (their pampered pups). Until now, that is.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: YouTube</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">The Royalty Family baby just made his entrance.</h2><p>The family made a prank video about Andrea’s water breaking back in May, but it really did just a few days ago. They shared up-close-and-personal footage of their labor and delivery journey, which was no surprise since the entire pregnancy has been well-documented on YouTube.</p><p>In December 2019, they posted a video announcing the long-awaited pregnancy — which fans had been speculating about for months.&nbsp;</p><p>“I’ve been wanting to have a baby for a long time, and I know that Ali wants it too, and Ferran,” an emotional Andrea shares in the video. She lets viewers look at the pregnancy test before she does, saying that she’s too nervous to look.</p><p>Of course, the test was positive, and another heir or heiress was on its way.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: YouTube</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">But fans haven’t met the baby just yet.</h2><p>Much more baby-related content came after the announcement, including the first ultrasound, a gender reveal, and a minor health scare. There are also multiple videos where the family enlists the help of their fans in choosing a first letter for their baby name of their little boy on the way.</p><p>They started referring to the baby as “Prince M.,” and two <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">labor and delivery videos</a> have been posted to The Royalty Family channel so far — but the world has yet to meet the baby.</p><p>“Guys, he’s here. Our prince is here,” an emotional Ali says. “We can’t wait for you guys to meet our precious prince.”</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: YouTube</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">This is Ali’s first biological son.</h2><p>Fans often assume that Ferran is Ali’s birth son, but actually, he is Ali’s stepson.</p><p>Born in Colombia, Andrea had Ferran from a previous relationship before she met Ali, who is Lebanese. So Prince M. is the Espada’s first biological child together.</p><p>Ferran’s biological father’s identity has not been revealed.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="margin:8px 0 0;padding:0 4px"><a href=# style=color:#000;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none;word-wrap:break-word>Changing the world one day at a time... @kingferran @4kpapi #royaltyfamily</a></p><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap">A post shared by <a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px>The royalty Family 👑</a> (@royaltyfamily) on Jul 22, 2019 at 9:39am PDT</p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">There’s reason to believe Prince M. will be a future influencer.</h2><p>Fans haven’t even met the new baby yet, but there’s already speculation that he will become a YouTuber or social media sensation like his big bro.</p><p>Ferran first caught people’s attention for his love of fashion when Andrea was working as a UFC host.
