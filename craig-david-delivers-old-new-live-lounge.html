We’re pretty hooked on his song right now, and this version has made us love it even more.</p><p>Next up was the ultimate mashup remix. What do you get if you throw together Craig’s classic hit ‘Fill Me In’, mash it up with Justin Bieber, Diplo and Skrillex’s ‘Where Are U Now’ and add an insane original rap? ’16 (Fill Me In) of course! This track has been a huge hit for Craig during his live shows this summer and we never get tired of hearing his golden vocals alongside him spitting verses. This track is a perfect combination of new meeting old, and reminds us that although Craig has been in the industry for sixteen years, he remains as fresh as ever.</p><p>Craig later performed a new song called ‘Couldn’t Be Mine’, which will appear on his new album <i>Following My Intuition</i>. The slick RnB song is fairly reminiscent of Craig’s older material but also showcases what we can expect to hear from his new era of music.</p><p>Finally, Craig delivered the Live Lounge cover we’d been waiting for – a mash up of Destiny’s Child ‘Say My Name’ and Solo 45’s ‘Feed Em To The Lions’. Craig’s soulful vocals were perfectly suited to this Destiny’s Child classic, and worked well with the ‘Feed Em To The Lions’ interlude. He also delivered a superb rap, proving his worth as a lyricist and rapper.</p><p>Watch Craig David’s Live Lounge performance <a href=#>here</a>.</p><p>Radio 1’s Live Lounge continues next week with performances from Kano, Christine and the Queens, Bastille and Charlie Puth.</p><p>Did you enjoy Craig David’s Live Lounge?
