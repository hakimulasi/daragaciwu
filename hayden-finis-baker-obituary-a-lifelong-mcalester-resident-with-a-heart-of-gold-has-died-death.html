Hayden’s presence in McAlester was woven into the fabric of the town, and his legacy will undoubtedly live on. Hayden’s journey began on January 25, 1956, when he was born to Hayden J.

His dedication and skill shone through in every project he undertook, leaving a trail of satisfied clients and beautifully painted homes. But Hayden’s impact extended far beyond his professional life. He was a true handyman at heart, and his love for fixing things around the house was well-known in the community. Whether it was a leaky faucet, a creaky door, or a broken window, Hayden was always ready to lend a hand.</p><p>His ability to solve problems and his willingness to help others became defining traits that endeared him to his family and friends.

Beyond his immediate family, Hayden was a cherished stepfather to Kathy, Sandra, Kerry, Allisa, and Jason. His memory will be held dear by his numerous nieces, nephews, and other extended family members, as well as his many friends.</p><p>Sadly, Hayden had to say goodbye to several loved ones before his passing. He was preceded in death by his wife, Terry D. Baker, his parents Edith and Hayden J. Baker, his brother Dewane Ramsey, and his grandmothers, Nellie Hicks and Dora Griffith. His niece, Bryliegh White, also holds a special place in his heart and memory. Hayden Finis Baker’s legacy is one of hard work, dedication, and a willingness to support and uplift those around him.
