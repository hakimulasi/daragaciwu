His first major paycheck from a movie came when Affleck starred in Paycheck where he reportedly earned his first $15 million. Once he hit the map at the Oscars, the Affleck net worth would only grow, and his paychecks would with it. He is still a respectable A-lister today.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading joli-heading" id=the-early-life-of-ben-affleck><strong>The Early Life of Ben Affleck</strong></h2><p>Ben Geza Affleck-Boldt is a California-born actor, born on August 15, 1972, to his father Tim Affleck, and his mother Chris Affleck. The Affleck net worth of this family was a middle-class net worth, with a father as a dreaming playwright and a mom as a school teacher. Until his parent’s divorce, Benjamin Geza Affleck would watch his parents take on every job, carpenter, electrician, janitor, and bookie, to make ends meet so their children could reach their dreams.</p><p>In Massachusetts, Ben Affleck became involved in theatre and performing, and his passion was born. Ben Affleck&nbsp;would not only attend the theatre but would also make friends with those involved. It was here that he met Matt Damon at the age of eight.

Ben Affleck’s life would never be the same again. Ben Affleck net potential would also never be the same again, a key perk of becoming an Academy Award winner, the most successful outcome of Good Will Hunting for Affleck.</p><p>That outcome wasn’t the original plan. Matt Damon and Ben Affleck were given a 40-page assignment in a screenwriting class. They were frustrated with the lack of support in class and were upset that they had given up acting roles for this screenwriting course. It worked out. Years later, they became Academy Award winners instead. When Ben Affleck made it on the map, so did Matt Damon. The production company Pearl Street Films was born, and the Ben Affleck net worth potential would only grow from here.</p><p>It wouldn’t be the only production company for Ben Affleck. Live Planet would become one of his developments later on.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading joli-heading" id=ben-afflecks-personal-life><strong>Ben Affleck’s Personal Life</strong></h2><p>The personal life of Ben Affleck has been newsworthy for entertainment fans. He was involved with Jennifer Lopez between 2002 and 2004, a time in his life when Ben Affleck’s net worth was enough to purchase a $65 million dollar home. They became engaged early in their relationship but the relationship did not stand the test of time.</p><p>By 2005, Ben Affleck had married Jennifer Garner, whom he had two children with.
