Her eldest rocked a Cinderella gown, while her little brothers wore zippered onesies — a dragon for Hayes and a monster for Hart.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Meghan-King-Edmonds-Pumpkin-Patch-With-Kids-Promo.jpg><p>This festive excursion came two days after the former Bravo personality and Jim split after five years of marriage. The former professional baseball player, 49, <a href=#>spoke to Us Weekly exclusively about their divorce and allegations that he cheated</a> on his wife with one of their four nannies, <strong>Carly Wilson</strong>.</p><p>“It’s dangerous, irresponsible and hurtful to all to allow a rumor to be spread to the world because of insecurities,” the athlete said.</p><p><a href=#>Wilson also denied the affair</a>, telling a commenter on Instagram that the accusations are “completely false.”</p><p><a href=#>Meghan confronted them</a> a week before the split, a source told Us.&nbsp;“The nanny is someone who has worked for them for years and is like family,” the insider said. “During the argument [about it], Meghan called the cops, but nothing came of it. Jim didn’t put his hands on her. The police chalked it up to a verbal dispute. No arrests were made.”</p><p>In June, Jim was caught sending inappropriate texts to a woman Us later identified as <a href=#><strong>Jennifer McFelia Villegas</strong></a>. Meghan addressed the messages<a href=#> in a blog post</a> at the time, writing, “I love him. How can I turn my feelings around so quickly? How can one person decide to utterly ruin me? It’s not fair. I sob so much my face stings from the salt from my tears. I am exhausted. My poor kids aren’t getting their devoted mother. And it’s only been 36 hours.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p><a href=#>Jim denied having a “physical relationship”</a> with the woman, telling Us exclusviely, “I had a lapse in judgment.”</p><p>The estranged couple tied the knot in 2014.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8r7HWrGamnZedrq95yqKloGWVmbqwusOsZKmno5rAbsPIrZ9mo5mZwG6t02anrqWgoLavec%2Baq5ygXZu8rbjOsKCnn12ova2102g%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JamBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
