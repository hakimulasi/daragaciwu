(Gorga — as she explained to Giudice — was simply a bartender at the venue, and only for one week.)</p><p>“I never believed Melissa was a stripper, but it just seems like a coinkie-dink.” Giudice said later, after Gorga swore on her children she had never danced.</p><p>All hell broke loose when Vrohidis — a former manager at Lookers — was overheard telling a fellow patron about Giudice and DePaola’s plan to “blow the whistle on” Gorga. Later, <strong>Jacqueline Laurita </strong>even received text messages about the plan, said to have been two weeks in the making.”I can’t help but think Kim D had a huge part in this,” fumed Gorga when she realized she’d been had. “With Kim D setting me up, does Teresa mean to tell me she had no idea this was going on? I’m sorry, it’s not adding up.”</p><p>As Gorga, 33, fumed, Giudice, 40, maintained her innocence, insisting that “my conscience is clear.” Once Giudice’s brother, <strong>Joe Gorga</strong>, became involved at the urging of wife Melissa, he vowed never to speak to his sister again, sending her a text after the fashion show reading “you are dead to me.”</p><p><img decoding=async width=467 height=630 src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all" alt="Melissa Us Cover" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“It’s so hard for me to put myself in Teresa’s shoes because I’d never try to hurt anybody,” Gorga tells the new issue of <a href=#><strong>Us Weekly</strong></a>. “Maybe she thought my husband didn’t know that I worked there. Maybe she was trying to hurt my marriage. Maybe it will make her happy when everyone is as miserable is Teresa is. That’s a sick individual. It’s even sicker that she would put this on national TV.”</p><p>Continued an emotional Gorga: “This is one of the worst betrayals of my life.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKSepJmowKJ5xqipoJldmLyvstGopa2rXamys7HSmmSgoaWZtqSxjKitnqpdqMGztc%2BpnKufkamybr%2FErWSuqF1nfXJ%2BkW1waA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JamBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
