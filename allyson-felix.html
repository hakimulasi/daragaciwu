She was into weightlifting at that time and could easily deadlift at least 270 pounds at that age.</li><li>She discovered her athletic talents only after she had tried out for track in the 9th grade. About 2 months later, she had stood 7th in the 200 meters event at the CIF (California Interscholastic Federation) California State Meet.</li><li>The following season, she had won 5 medals at the meet. In 2001, she had achieved her first international title when she had triumphed in the 100 meters event at the World Youth Championships.</li><li>In her senior year, she had stood 2nd in the 200 meters event at the US Indoor Track & Field Championships. A few months later, in Mexico City, she had clocked a time of 22.11 seconds which was the fastest time recorded by a high school girl in history. It, however, could not be counted as an official world junior record because there was no drug testing at the event.</li><li>In 2003, after her high school graduation, she had given up her college eligibility to sign a professional contract with Adidas. The company had paid her an undisclosed sum and had picked up her college tuition fees at the University of Southern California.</li><li>She holds the record for being the first female track and field athlete to ever win 7 Olympic ‘Gold’ medals.</li><p>Featured Image by Allyson Felix / Instagram</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiglZa5tbTYnJylnZJjsLC5jpqjpbGjpLtussSloLFn</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JamBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
