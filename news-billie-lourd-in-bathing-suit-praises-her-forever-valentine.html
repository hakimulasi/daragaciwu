I am passionately obsessed with their egg sandwich – it has pretty much all of my favorite foods on one beautiful English muffin – collard greens, bacon, avocado, hot sauce and a fried egg. How could you not start your day with that?!" she told the </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>New Potato</span></a><span>. She also loves chicken and sushi. These kinds of proteins are great, especially when accompanied by fiber. A high-fiber, high-protein breakfast may be the most important investment you can make in your waistline. That's the finding of a study from the University of Missouri in Columbia, which found that eating breakfast triggered women's brains to release dopamine, a feel-good chemical that helps to control impulses.</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebwell.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/02/Billie-Lourd.png><p><span>"I'm definitely not a believer in counting calories in any way shape or form. I've always loved food and have a hard time wrapping my head around the idea of a diet. Food is life!" she told the New Potato. Good call. Way more important than counting calories is eating the right mix of nourishing foods. To balance out your meals, add in lean proteins (think chicken and fish) and healthy fats (like guacamole or flaxseed oil), with fiber, which will help to heal your body and keep you satiated.</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebwell.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/02/GettyImages-1345724580.jpg><p><span>"So to make sure I can eat the way I do (aggressively), I have to balance it out with at least a litttttle exercise. I love doing yoga and for any of you 80's fans out there, I'm not ashamed to say I do 8 minute abs at least twice a week (don't judge me, I love the weird music and the guy's encouraging 80's trainer voice). I also take my French bulldog Tina on a solid run around my neighborhood every morning that I can," she told the New Potato.</span></p><p><span></span><span aria-hidden=true>df44d9eab23ea271ddde7545ae2c09ec</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebwell.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/02/GettyImages-1257842825.jpg><p>"Researchers have also shown that<span>&nbsp;</span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=# data-reactid=341>dog owners are more active</a><span>&nbsp;</span>than those who don't own dogs, packing in more steps per day on their walks or just regular playtime.

"I love being my mother's daughter, and it's something I always will be, but now I get to be just Billie."
