Cameron’s former Titanic star Kate Winslet plays a major role, and The Sopranos Edie Falco plays a supporting role, as does The Rock’s fellow Moana voice actor Jemaine Clement. But Johnson himself did not actually appear anywhere on the computer-generated surface (or even below the sea) of Pandora.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><p lang=en dir=ltr>This is the “TULKUN” way <a href=#>#Avatar</a> <a href=#>#AvatarTheWayOfWater</a> <a href=#>#Tonowari</a> <a href=#>#Metkayina</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/pKDdFziwmG</a></p>— ja’kobitheprophet (@kobitheprophet) <a href=#>September 28, 2022</a></figure><p data-characters=529 data-current-count=829 data-injectable=true>It seems that many are mistaking two other actors in the movie for Johnson. One is New Zealand actor Cliff Curtis, who portrays Tonowari, the chief of the seaside-dwelling Metkayina clan. While Curtis and Johnson both share Polynesian ethnicity — Curtis is of Maori descent, and Johnson has Samoan heritage —neither actor would likely be mistaken as the other in real life. However, the intense CGI necessary to make a human actor look like an alien Na’vi appears to have left some people unable to tell the two apart.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><p lang=en dir=ltr>there's a guy in avatar 2 who looks uncannily like the rock but I can't find anything about it because there's another guy that all the news articles said looks like the rock even though he doesn't at all</p>— Space Ritual Live (@lumerianfeasts) <a href=#>January 1, 2023</a></figure><p data-characters=617 data-current-count=917 data-injectable=true>People may also be mistaking the Rock for one of the bad guys in The Way of Water. Of course, the character is still heavily CGI-ed. While some people aren’t seeing it, a smaller segment of “observant” fans seem to have mistaken actor Matt Gerald, who plays Corporal Lyle Wainfleet, a member of Colonel&nbsp;Miles Quaritch’s recombinant strike team in the film. Once again, Gerald isn’t really someone you’d mistake for the almost supernaturally swole Dwayne Johnson but put a lair of CGI on him and then put on a pair of 3D glasses… and he kind of looks like The Rock? A little?</p><p data-characters=217 data-current-count=217 data-injectable=false>There’s no telling why folks are projecting The Rock onto planet pandora but there’s still plenty of time for James Cameron to make it a reality. There are still<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"> two more </a>(at least!)
