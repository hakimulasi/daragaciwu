Made up of frontman Aidan Hall, lead guitarist Landed Gruszewski, bass player Colin McMillen and drummer Alex Dooley, the band have worked hard towards creating their own unapologetic sound.</p><p>Kicking&nbsp;off&nbsp;their&nbsp;2019&nbsp;in&nbsp;style,&nbsp;Something&nbsp;Else released their new self-titled EP on January 4, which showcases their growth as a band and their determination to make honest music. The EP includes the previously released ‘Breathe’ and ‘Purpose’.</p><p>We spoke to Something Else just before they released their self-titled EP to get the lowdown on their new music.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebmix.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/exclusive-something-else-discuss-new-self-titled-ep-01.jpeg><p><strong>Your self-titled EP will be released at the beginning of January. How are you feeling ahead of its release?</strong><br></p><p>Very excited, we’ve all been anxious to release these songs since our first day in the studio. We can’t wait for everyone to hear it.<br></p><p><strong>Fans have already heard two of the tracks, ‘Breathe’ and ‘Purpose’, but what can be expected from the rest of the EP?</strong><br></p><p>Much like those two tracks, the rest of the EP is very introspective and self aware. The songs on the EP continue to call out the fear, hypocrisy, and self doubt that people struggle to admit to themselves.<br></p><figure class="wp-block-embed-spotify wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-spotify wp-embed-aspect-9-16 wp-has-aspect-ratio"></figure><p><strong>What was the creative process like on the EP? How long did it take to come together?</strong><br></p><p>Some of the songs have been around for a while, constantly being tweaked and perfected. Others, like our song ‘Purpose’, came closer to the time we arrived in the studio to start recording. In all, we spent about three weeks in the studio recording and producing. The songs all seemed to take on a new shape by the end, we’re all very into it.<br></p><p><strong>The EP is made up of seven tracks – was it a difficult process to choose which songs would make the final cut?</strong><br></p><p>Not at all, we picked the songs we believe to be the strongest and are proud of what the EP became.<br></p><p><strong>Whilst we appreciate that you love the EP in its entirety, is there a particular song which stand out as a favorite of yours? We’re really loving ‘Shadow’.</strong><br></p><p>Alex: I really enjoy the song ‘Nobody Has To Know’</p><p>Landen: I love the energy of ‘Mess’ and believe we captured that on the recording.</p><p>Colin: ‘Breathe’ has a special spot in my heart because the song came from a low point in the band yet we came out of it with one of our most dynamic tracks to date.</p><p>Aidan: It’s very hard for me to choose because every track holds their own weight in my heart, and depending on the time of day it could change. I catch myself listening to ‘The Fool’, and ‘Go Away’ a lot. Both very emotional on two opposite ends of the spectrum.<br></p><figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><p><strong>If you had to pick one lyric which best sums up the EP, what would it be?</strong><br></p><p>“Rewriting the plot for how my life goes, suffering from writers block.”<br></p><p><strong>Do you have any other live shows planned that you can tell us about?</strong><br></p><p>February 2nd we are playing an acoustic set at The Shrunken Head in Columbus, and will have the chance to play our whole EP stripped down.<br></p><p><strong>Who are some of your main musical influences?</strong><br></p><p>My Chemical Romance, Michael Jackson, The Beatles, Failure, Green Day, John Mayer, Jimmy Eat World, The 1975, The Killers, The Strokes…the list is too long.<br></p><p><strong>With 2018 coming to an end, what has been your highlight of the year?</strong><br></p><p>Playing the sold out 90’s Kids release show was a blast. Traveling around the states and meeting so many great people has been amazing as well.<br></p><p><strong>What are your hopes for 2019?</strong><br></p><p>Touring, hard. Taking our music to new places for new people.</p><p>Thank you to Something Else for their time.
