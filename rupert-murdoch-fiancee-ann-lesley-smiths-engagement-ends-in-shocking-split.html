The 92-year-old magnate of the media industry, who possesses an extensive collection of news organizations such as Fox News, The Wall Street Journal, and the New York Post, has purportedly terminated his marriage to the 66-year-old presenter and clergywoman Ann Lesley Smith.</p><p data-private=redact data-wt-guid=f6feb300-ca12-4305-815c-f53033666939>A confidant of the billionaire disclosed to The Times that the marriage had been canceled. Although the tycoon of the press has been reticent regarding the conjectured dissolution, a report by Vanity Fair alleged that the billionaire had become awkward with Smith’s traditional convictions on life.</p><h2 data-private=redact data-wt-guid=9dd25f31-1bd3-49d6-b48d-d401c0299476>It’s The End Of An Intense Yet High-Profile Romance</h2><p data-private=redact data-wt-guid=217af885-6218-433d-baac-161762feabcc>Based on the information provided, it appears that media mogul Rupert Murdoch and his girlfriend, model actress Jerry Hall Smith, have recently broken up. The couple had been in a highly publicized and somewhat tumultuous relationship, with photos of them on holiday in various exotic locations appearing in the media.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.llanelliherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/9445dee58847afdbe93839f11cffa16e362dd300-16x9-x0y239w2750h1547.jpg alt width=810 height=456 sizes="(max-width: 810px) 100vw, 810px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p data-private=redact data-wt-guid=08529b07-06e0-4c43-9237-6c734233f6cc>There were also reports that Murdoch was in talks to purchase a $30 million home, which may have been intended as a new residence for the couple. However, the relationship ended abruptly, with the couple no longer together. Murdoch had proposed to Smith on St. Patrick’s Day in 2022, presenting her with an expensive diamond ring, and had spoken positively about their relationship to the media. Despite his earlier comments about hoping this would be his last love affair, the relationship has ended, ending this high-profile romance.</p><h2 data-private=redact data-wt-guid=c2b7f389-d3f8-4e5e-8fc0-dbcb76cb4f22>An Overview of Rupert Murdoch’s Marriages</h2><p data-private=redact data-wt-guid=1b787b4d-8d4e-408f-9a87-13b6db1aa318>Rupert Murdoch, an eminent magnate in the media industry, has had a decades-long career under the spotlight. Yet, despite his advanced age of 92, Murdoch’s love life and relationship status remain a subject of intrigue.</p><p data-private=redact data-wt-guid=23c5e359-a5dd-43ba-a7a6-1bc232a7b6f6>The Australian tycoon has recently announced his engagement to Ann Lesley Smith, a former police chaplain, marking his fifth time walking down the aisle. Murdoch has four previous marriages and divorces under his belt, with his most recent divorce from model Jerry Hall being finalized last year.</p><p data-private=redact data-wt-guid=74426dba-e894-4442-8f7b-281641d241da>Murdoch’s first marriage to Patricia Booker occurred in 1956, during the early stages of his career when he was 25 years old. Booker, a former international flight attendant, bore him a daughter named Prudence in 1958. Their marriage ended in divorce after 11 years.</p><p data-private=redact data-wt-guid=6ce29e73-b1b8-4f2b-9c74-e38ab3e137b2>In the same year his divorce from Booker was finalized, Murdoch tied the knot with Anna Torv, a Scottish-born woman he met while she was working at his newspaper, The Daily Telegraph. This union would be his longest-lasting marriage, spanning from 1967 to 1999. The couple had three children together, Elisabeth, Lachlan, and James. Their split was amicable, as Torv desired Murdoch to retire with her, which he believed would harm his health.</p><p data-private=redact data-wt-guid=6ce29e73-b1b8-4f2b-9c74-e38ab3e137b2><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.llanelliherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/570220.jpg alt width=660 height=371 sizes="(max-width: 660px) 100vw, 660px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p data-private=redact data-wt-guid=5ce0410f-76fa-4d82-9168-8f6bb3d1bed1>Murdoch met Wendi Deng, a Chinese-born intern at a Hong Kong television station owned by his News Corp, while he was still married to Torv. They exchanged vows on Murdoch’s yacht just three weeks after his divorce from Torv was finalized in 1999. Deng, who was 31 then, bore Murdoch two daughters, Grace and Chloe. However, their relationship eventually soured, and Murdoch filed for divorce from Deng in June 2013.</p><p data-private=redact data-wt-guid=00ccc3fd-eff8-41fd-94ff-5e069f7432a9>In 2015, Murdoch began seeing Jerry Hall, a former model, and actress popular in the ’70s and ’80s, despite their 25-year age gap. The couple engaged in January 2011 and were married in March, two months later. They released no official statement and ended their marriage in August last year.</p><p data-private=redact data-wt-guid=ab1299f4-25ee-4ada-87e8-5fe61f8c5b88>The split between Rupert Murdoch and Ann Lesley Smith came as a shock to many.
