One user claimed in February that the Oscar winner was not responsible for the witty remarks. “These comments from gwyn are fake as f–k,” the commenter alleged. “Feel bad for poor millennial that ghost writes them. Hope they are getting paid well or some goop credit.”</p><p>Paltrow, however, did not take the accusation lightly. “Sit on it I write all this dumb stuff myself you jackass,” she responded. “What else do moms do in the bath with a glass of wine.”</p><p>The Goop founder, who shares daughter Apple, 14, and son Moses, 13, with ex-husband <a href=#><strong>Chris Martin</strong></a>, revealed in January that her kids are not impressed by her. “I am <a href=#>mortifying</a>. Like, I am the most embarrassing person all of a sudden,” she said during an appearance on&nbsp;The Rachael Ray Show. “It’s been, like, a couple good years that I’ve been the most embarrassing person.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>She added: “If I do anything silly in public, the color drains from [Apple’s] face. Any silly jokes, or if I dance, like in a store, God forbid. She’s like, ‘Mom!’ and I’m like, ‘OK, sorry, got it.’”</p><p>Paltrow was married to Martin for 10 years. After <a href=#>they “consciously uncoupled,”</a> the actress tied the knot with <a href=#><strong>Brad Falchuk</strong></a> in September 2018.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZJunlK58r7HWrGagr6mjsrW0jKmYpayipMRuucCsq56qlqq5rcWMnZyfnZ6ZwG6Aj6xkraGkqbamv4yopWahnqjBorPRmqRo</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JamBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
