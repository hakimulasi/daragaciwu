You may not know his name, but he's mega rich and mega famous in the outdoor furniture world.<br>Dekeyser, who was a pro soccer goalkeeper early in his career, is now a guru of super cool outdoor furniture. He even opened the Dedon Island Resort on the island of Siargao where his furniture is displayed and outdoor activity is emphasized. In short, it's amazing.<br>As far as his personal life goes, he started dating Gershon around 2012, two years after his wife died. While on a business trip to the Philippines in 2010, Dekeyser received the news that his wife of two decades, Ann-Kathrin, was in a coma back in Germany. She died before he could make it back to her. This tragedy serves as the opening to his highly successful autobiography.<br>Now, he and Gershon have a place in NYC and lots of other places around the globe. “We’re modern gypsies, both of us,” Dekeyser says about himself and Gershon. “I don’t have an office anywhere in the world.
