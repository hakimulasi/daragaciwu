You got cancer,” he rapped. “Damn Just beat death penalty, now I got cancer?/Father God, I need answers/News to my ears, shit real from the doctor/He said, ‘Boosie, boy you got cancer,’ I cried for hours/Jumped in the shower, stressing, and cried to my mama and my nana/I can’t believe this shit/Cancer got me scared like I’m ’bout to leave this bitch.”</p><p>But according to a recent tweet, the Baton Rouge native can finally put that chapter to bed. On Wednesday (March 17), the BadAzz Music Syndicate boss took to Instagram to share a video of himself during his annual doctor’s appointment.</p><p>AD LOADING...</p><p>“ANNUAL CANCER CHECK-UP,” he captioned the post. “ALL MY FAMILY N FANS SAY A PRAYER FOR ME AS I WAIT ON MY RESULTS. #prayerispowerful #fuckcancer. He followed up with the good news on Twitter, writing, “IM CANCER&nbsp;FREE. #tearofjoy Thanks to everybody said a prayer for me #GODISGREAT.”</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>IM CANCER ♋️ FREE <a href=#>#tearofjoy</a> Thanks to everybody said a prayer for me <a href=#>#GODISGREAT</a></p><p>— Boosie BadAzz (@BOOSIEOFFICIAL) <a href=#>March 17, 2021</a></p><p>Boosie — who also has diabetes — was given the devastating diagnosis in November 2015 and quickly underwent a nephrectomy to remove the cancer. TMZ revealed he didn’t have health insurance so he wound up paying $90,000 for the procedure, which he’d presumably do again if it meant <a class=underline-link href=# rel=noopener>saving his life.</a> Boosie thanked everyone for their support prior to procedure.</p><p>AD LOADING...</p><p>“To all my family, fans n supporters I really appreciate the love n concern that’s been giving to me since I was diagnosed with kidney cancer,” he wrote at the time. “I go n for surgery n I need prayers for a great surgery n rehabilitation.”</p><p>During Boosie’s health struggles, he also had to face accusations of <a class=underline-link href=# rel=noopener>making up the illness.&nbsp;</a>In 2016, he shared a photo of his surgical scar to his Instagram account and wrote in the caption, “I’m tired of these stupid muthafuckas saying I ain’t have cancer sending me DMs asking why am I lying saying I had cancer. who wants to fake or lie about something like that not me, not a real one [100] [100] wtf u mad cause I asked for prayers n gottem. I don’t get it. well mf’s this my cancer scar a week after my surgery (FACTS).”</p><p>Revisit the “Cancer” video below.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmigmaW1sLzDsWWcp51ku6bD0mignWZmZn5zgo6toK2klWOvsLvSopxmmpGZrrvGjKucr52RocButMSsZKysmaG5bq%2FAp5qeql2bv6axjJ%2BmpaSfrLavs4yapaetkaF6tK%2FRnpynoZ6cerWxwKumn6Kfrg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JamBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
