Former 7th Heaven star <strong>Mackenzie Rosman</strong> strips down to skimpy lingerie in a sexy pictorial for the September issue of <a href=#>Maxim</a>. The 23-year-old actress, who played the religious family’s youngest daughter, Ruthie Camden, acknowledges that the racy photo shoot will likely cause some controversy.</p><p>When asked if people will “be surprised” to see her in such a provocative state, the former child star replies, “They might be. But you know what? It’s who I am.”</p><p>Rosman isn’t the first 7th Heaven star to pose for a men’s magazine: <a href=#><strong>Jessica</strong> <strong>Biel</strong></a>, who played her big sister, Mary, posed topless on the cover of Gear in 2000. At the time, Biel was 17 and Rosman was 9. “I remember that. It was a big deal,” Rosman recalls. “The magazine was banned on set, I think by orders of <strong>Aaron Spelling</strong>. I sneaked a peek at it, though. It was racy gossip amongst the women of 7th Heaven.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all"><p>(Biel later admitted that she regrets her racy spread, telling Entertainment Weekly in November 2008, “That photo shoot was just a really bad decision on my part and I got myself involved with people who weren’t thinking about me and were instead thinking about what kind of a story they could get out of it.”)</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Despite the trouble Biel’s Gear cover caused on set, Rosman tells <a href=#>Maxim</a> she “looked up to Jessie a lot. She and I connected; we were just more alike than the others.”</p><p>When it comes to dating, Rosman says she values “manners” above all else. “Like, just be respectful. I don’t deal with the whole bad boy who doesn’t call you,” she says. “That doesn’t interest me at all, and I just look the other way.”</p><p>Rossman also reveals that she has a boyfriend — though she doesn’t divulge the lucky guy’s name.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZJunlK58r7HWrGammZOgsq%2FGyJ5kq6ejoq6vedGuq6GhlWKzs7vMZm6toF2dsqLCxKdkrKyinr20edOoZKWhnpyys7XEZp2oql2irrm1zGZpaWljZ4Z4ew%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JamBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
