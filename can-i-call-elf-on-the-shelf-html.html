Add a pinch of cinnamon to the area around your Scout Elf. Cinnamon is similar to vitamins for your elf, and it will assist him or her in returning to the North Pole so that the elf doctors can give them a speedy check-up. Take time to sing a Christmas song with your loved ones!</p><p></p><h3>I was also asked whether I could communicate with the elves.</h3><p>A unique mode of communication exists between genuine elves and their counterparts in all other races. But it isn’t done with words or in a new language in the way that you would expect. Our eyes, our faces, and our thoughts are all ways in which we may communicate. An elf working alongside another elf does not need to communicate in order to do the tasks assigned to them.</p><p></p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-148 data-inserter-version=2></span><h3>What is the best way to get an elf on the shelf to visit your home?</h3><p>Finding the Elf on the Shelf® and Getting Him To Visit You</p><p>Visit a Scout Elf Adoption Center that has been authorised by the organisation.
