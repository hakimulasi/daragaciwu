He shares two children with his first wife, Lee Ann Horton, who passed away in 2015. He also welcomed a son and daughter with second wife <strong>Allison Jayne Raski</strong>, from whom he split in 2014.</p><p>In October 2014, Edmonds exchanged vows with <a href=#><strong>Meghan King</strong></a>, who joined the cast of <a href=#>The Real Housewives of Orange County </a>shortly after the wedding. The pair welcomed <a href=#>daughter Aspen</a> in November 2016 and <a href=#>twin sons Hayes and Hart</a> in June 2018. Two years after the boys’ arrival, the duo called it quits, with King claiming that Edmonds had been unfaithful with a nanny. (He <a href=#>denied the allegations</a> at the time.)</p><p>As the dramatic breakup continued, the Bravo star <a href=#>opened up about having a threesome with Edmonds</a> and another woman in the early days of their marriage. “I knew that Jim had this bad boy kind of past,” she said during a January 2020 episode of her “Intimate Knowledge” podcast, noting that she chose someone she was “comfortable” to help <a href=#>spice up her sex life</a> with Edmonds.</p><p>The same woman, King alleged, had joined the California native on a Mexican getaway for his birthday. “This threesome girl,” she said. “This girl who I thought was my friend. … I think they’ve probably had sex more than the one time.”</p><p>Us Weekly later confirmed that the friend in question was O’Connor, who quarantined with Edmonds amid the <a href=#>coronavirus pandemic</a> in early 2020. The couple made their romance Instagram official that April.</p><p>Following a slew of public spats, <a href=#>King and Edmonds finalized their divorce</a> in May 2021. “I feel the same as I did before it was finalized,” the Missouri native told Us exclusively. “I think it’s, like, an energetic closure, which is important, but I mean, I’ve been learning how to be independent ever since we separated. … It feels good.”</p><p>At the time, King noted that she was “having a lot of fun dating,” but craved a strong partnership like the one Edmonds found with O’Connor, who he proposed to in July 2021.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“I would feel that stability for my children is what I care about the most,” King told Us two months before Edmonds’ engagement. “So any kind of <a href=#>long-term committed relationship</a> that Jim is in, I fully, fully support because that’s absolutely the best for my children.”</p><p>Scroll down for a closer look at Edmonds and O’Connor’s love story:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8sbXCrayrnaNkt6q5jJ6bpqeemcBurc2dZKSnoqm7qrGMqJqopp6kv7R50Z6jmqyZpLu0tMipZK2hnZq5qrrEaA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JamBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
