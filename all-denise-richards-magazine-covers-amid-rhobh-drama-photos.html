I only got me two of the covers that we’d all want to be on. DANG,” she wrote. “And I’m selling sex. Dang again. Oh well. [My mom] Lois loves them.”</p><p>Denise previously shared seven of her old magazine covers in May 2020 after <a href=#>Kyle referred to her as a ragamuffin</a>. “Going down memory lane with this #ragamuffin,” she captioned her Instagram post. “Just a few covers to share for #tbt.”</p><p>The&nbsp;Halloween Kills&nbsp;star caused a stir when she <a href=#>dissed Denise</a> after the&nbsp;Wild Things&nbsp;actress defended her in a fight with the other Housewives. “This one, who’s never worn anything but a f–king mop top ponytail her whole life,” Kyle whispered before calling her a ragamuffin.</p><p>Kyle later changed her tune, though, leaving a heartfelt comment on Denise’s Instagram post featuring her former covers. “Denise, you are absolutely beautiful. There is no doubt about that,” she replied. “I was exhausted, emotional & felt everyone was coming at me. I got upset because I thought you of all people would get what I was saying because you yourself say you don’t get the glam thing and just wear a messy top knot. So I didn’t get the sudden change.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>She added: “With that said, I still regret that comment and was not the best version of myself that night. My apologies.”</p><p>Scroll down to take a look at all of Denise’s major magazine covers through the years, from&nbsp;Cosmopolitan&nbsp;to&nbsp;Redbook&nbsp;— with <a href=#>ex-husband</a> <a href=#><strong>Charlie Sheen</strong></a>! — and more.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS9qq%2FTrqmeq1%2BWua15w56loquVYr%2Bqr8eaqZ2rXaKuqK3ZoqWeZZOkw6a%2B0maYpqGUYr%2Bpu8GhZJ2qkaKubrzHqKuoq18%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JamBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
