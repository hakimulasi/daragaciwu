On Thursday, Nov. 20, the late comedian’s son <strong>Zak Williams</strong> spoke in public for the first time since his father’s passing on Aug. 11, telling <strong><a href=#>Us Weekly</a></strong> at the Christopher & Dana Reeve Foundation fundraising gala that he’s slowly adjusting to life without their dad.</p><p>“We’re doing okay,” Zak, 31, told <strong>Us</strong>, speaking on behalf of his family, which includes half-siblings Zelda, 25, and Cody, 22. (Zak’s mom is Williams’ first wife, Valerie Velardi; Zelda and Cody are his kids with second wife Marsha Garces.) “We’re acclimating to the new normal. Everything is step by step. Personally, my wife and I are focusing on doing a lot of good. She runs the San Francisco office of Human Rights Watch, and we’re working with them to do good in the world.”</p><p>That’s something that was very important to his father. Inside the event, Zak spoke about Williams’ friendship with the late <strong>Christopher Reeve</strong>, and how both men were dedicated to helping those in need.&nbsp;</p><p><img decoding=async width=467 height=377 src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all" alt="zak and robin" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“They had a tremendous love for one another,” Zak began, referring to Williams and Reeve. “The amazing thing about their relationship was their incredible drive to take the time to love, to help, and to appreciate others, even while they found themselves in great pain.”&nbsp;</p><p>He continued: “They always found time to give their all to those in need. Bringing light and healing where there’s darkness, pain, or suffering is absolutely vital.”&nbsp;</p><p>That’s a lesson Zak wants to pass on to his own kids. “Dad had almost a childlike love, and he shared that love with people, with everyone,” he told <strong>Us</strong>. “And that ability to love, and that ability to be generous and giving and kind is something we would want to share with future generations.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwNhmpZ6vo2S7psPSaKmompmjeri1y6WgmqWjYsCwuoyzmKRlo6WyorfSZqaurF2eu2681JujoptdlrO1sdFmn6KrXZmupb%2BMnZyarJhif3F9k2toamk%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JamBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
