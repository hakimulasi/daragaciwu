In the July issue of <a href=#>Cosmopolitan</a>, the pregnant actress' husband <a href=#><strong>Channing Tatum</strong></a> admits he's also got a healthy appetite. "I'm a fat kid on the inside," the White House Down actor reveals. "I love food so much, and I fluctuate about 25-30 pounds between movies."</p><p>Though Tatum is currently filming Jupiter Ascending in London (where his wife will give birth to their firstborn child any day), the 33-year-old star jokes that he'd like to find a project that requires less exercise.</p><p>"I feel like I have to do a chess movie that requires very little movement at some point, just so I can eat pizza and play chess on the beach all day," Tatum says. "And then eat more pizza and cheeseburgers and drink beer. That'd be amazing. I'd give anything for that. I gotta figure that movie out!"</p><p>Though Tatum doesn't divulge any baby details, he does reveal his secret to a happy marriage. "You have to want it," he explains. "Jenna's and my thing is checking in with each other all the time, like 'On a scale from 1 to 10, how much do you love me right now?' And you gotta be honest, and you've got to want an honest answer."</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>The 10 Years actress isn't the only one who's honest with Tatum. The Magic Mike actor tells <a href=#>Cosmopolitan</a> his childhood pals go to great lengths to ensure he doesn't get too big for his britches. "My friends keep me grounded. It's embarrassing to tell you how much my friends make fun of me," he laughs. "Seriously, when you have a doll made of your face, it's ridiculous how creative your friends can get â€” pictures, videos, little animated cartoons they've made. And they're way, way not PG-13. So I get chopped down to size all the time."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZJunlK58r7HWrGacoJGju6q6xmarmqylonqqecWlrJyspZbBpnnAm6aurF1ngm5%2Fj2anqK2emcBursStrp6dnmK6sMLInqpmamBmgHR8lGg%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JamBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
