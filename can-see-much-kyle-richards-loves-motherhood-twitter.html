Her sister is Kathy Hilton (yes, mother to Paris and hotel socialite) and her other sister is Kim Richards, famous child actress. She’s married to Mauricio Umansky, one of the leading real estate agents in the country, and they have several beautiful daughters. There is a lot you can say about Kyle, such as the fact that she seems to have some issues with some of the other housewives from time to time, or that that she seems to be a really good sister and friend to those she loves the most.</p><p>One thing you can absolutely say about her is that she is the kind of woman who clearly loves her children. You can see it in her scenes on the Housewives, you can see it in her posts about her kids on her social media accounts, and you can hear it in her interviews when she talks about how much her kids mean to her. She’s obviously a great mom with so much to offer her kids, and we love that about her. Check out a few of the examples of just how much&nbsp;<a href=#>Kyle Richards</a> loves her kids on her Twitter page.</p><p>So proud of you <a href=#>@farrahbritt</a> for being named one of @angelenomagazine’s <a href=#>#DynamicWomen</a> love you ❤️ <a href=#>http://t.co/bPzbKuZNUO</a></p><p>— Kyle Richards (@KyleRichards) <a href=#>December 18, 2014</a></p><p>It’s great to have a daughter who has paved her own way to success, and Kyle should be proud of her for that.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCtp5%2BXe6S7zGiamqZdqLKmecyumqFlm665pnnRopqhmaKZwG64zq%2BcrGWdpMGpsdGhpqicXanEqsDTnqlo</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JamBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
