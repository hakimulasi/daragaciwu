I've never been fond of it," the actor explained. "[The] vial of blood is very simple. You know those lockets you buy that are clear and you put a picture of your granny in and wear it around your neck? She bought two of those," he told the outlet.</p><p>"We were apart a lot because she's off making Tomb Raider and I'm making Monster’s Ball. She thought it would be interesting and romantic if we took a little razorblade and sliced our fingers, smeared a little blood on these lockets and you wear it around your neck just like you wear your son or daughter’s baby hair in one. Same thing. From that, we were wearing quart jars of blood around our necks. And we were vampires and we lived in a dungeon."</p><p>There was, in fact, no dungeon, Thornton insists. Reports suggesting there were, were the result of selective hearing.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>"I mean, it had some basis in fact. We had a basement which I had a recording studio in. So when I tell a journalist I stay down in the dungeon all the time, you know, recording music, they don’t hear 'recording music,' they hear 'dungeon,'" he explained. "You know, because it makes a better story."</p><p>Jolie and Thornton were married for 3 years from 2000 to 2003. In 2012 the actor told ABC's Nightline he still had a lot of affection for Jolie.</p><p>"We had a great time together," he said. "We had a great marriage and I chickened out because I didn't feel good enough. That's all that happened. It was no big deal, we never hated each other."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwNhmpZ6vo2S7psPSaJmipJyueqO7wWaroaeio8GwuoytmKWjo2Kur7PEpaCnmV2fvK21xGagrWWnlsBurYycqZqyqWLBqrnEZmlpaWRnf3J8</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JamBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
