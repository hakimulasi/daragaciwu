After all, what else can we expect from the biggest up-and-coming artist of our time?</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=486 data-current-count=486 data-injectable=true>As the music industry’s newest ace, with her iconic red hair, the rapper has certainly <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">secured a lifelong career in music since her debut</a> – especially now that she’s collaborated with none other than Miss Taylor Swift, I assume you might’ve heard of her once or twice. Karma, kind to those who earn it, has finally smiled upon Ice Spice, granting her the fame she undoubtedly deserves with a Grammy nomination – not an easy feat when you consider her humble roots.</p><p data-characters=395 data-current-count=395 data-injectable=false>That’s right, we’re not talking about ‘nepo babies’ when it comes to Ice Spice, even though her fame and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">ease on camera may suggest otherwise</a>. In reality, the rapper had a very ordinary upbringing, even if she often found herself in music studios as a toddler. So if you’re wondering <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">who raised today’s rising star</a>, here’s all about Ice’s parents.</p><h2 id=h-are-ice-spice-s-parents-famous data-injectable=false>Are Ice Spice’s parents famous?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" data-current-count=695 data-injectable=true><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Ice Spice (@icespice)</a></p></figure><p data-characters=380 data-current-count=380 data-injectable=false>Technically, no, her parents are not famous. However, if you’ve long been a fan of underground rap, you may have heard Ice Spice’s dad Joseph Gaston without realizing it. The young rapper has admitted that much of her passion for music is attributed to her father, but she still refuses to share his stage name per her father’s own request, as she told <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Variety</a>.</p><p>“You couldn’t find it for a reason — he’s such a private person, and that’s not even his lifestyle anymore.”</p><p data-characters=403 data-current-count=403 data-injectable=true>Nowadays, Gaston works in real estate, leaving the underground rap life behind. Nonetheless, the former rapper still vowed to introduce his little girl to some of the most iconic names in hip-hop, and it is safe to say that he unconsciously made his daughter into the worldwide phenomenon that she is today. Ice Spice, however, fully acknowledged her father’s role in her life for <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Paper Magazine</a>.</p><p>“I remember being in the studio with him. I was a toddler, probably. And I remember little flashes. Of course, not every detail, but small things like that being shown to you at such a young age make an impression on you. Subconsciously, I ended up becoming an artist because I saw my father be one first.”</p><p data-characters=403 data-current-count=724 data-injectable=true>Ice Spice’s mother, Charina Almanzar, was a car saleswoman when she met Gaston at 17, but the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Dominican’s relationship with the underground rapper</a> did not last long, since the couple divorced when Spice was just 2 years old. Nonetheless, despite her parents’ separation, Ice Spice was never forced to pick sides and she <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">even attributed</a> her “bad b*tch-isms,” to her mother.</p><p data-characters=384 data-current-count=384 data-injectable=false>Aside from her parents whom the rapper is undoubtedly incredibly fond of, Ice Spice is also the oldest of five siblings, often finding herself surrounded by her brothers, sisters, and cousins at her grandparents’ place while both her parents worked. Regardless of her populous upbringing, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">she admits</a> that she’s recently discovered that she loves “to be alone.”</p><p data-characters=363 data-current-count=747 data-injectable=false>One last piece of information that you might find interesting, is that <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Ice Spice’s real name is actually Isis Naija Gaston</a>. I know you might’ve thought her real name was Ice Spice, but let’s face it, Isis as a name <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">went out of fashion in 2013 for obvious reasons</a> and isn’t coming back anytime soon. Anyway, Ice Spice is much… cooler.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2TEqbuMmqmeZZmYsm6%2Fz6Kanqtdpa6zsc2tqmadqKW5orXNnpto</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JamBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
