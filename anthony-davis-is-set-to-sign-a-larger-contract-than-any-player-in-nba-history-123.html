He won both his first playoff game and series in a convincing sweep of the Portland Trailblazers. He also received All-NBA First Team honors, essentially saying he was the top player at his position this year.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>More importantly, the All-NBA nod means Davis can potentially make more money from one contract than any player before him.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Davis is now eligible for the supermax contract, assuming he re-signs with the Pelicans. The team can offer him a five-year deal next offseason worth <strong>$230 million</strong>. The deal would kick in starting in the 2020-21 season and would result in Davis having the wealthiest contract in the league.</span></p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-259906 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-900x/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/anthony.jpg alt width=900 height=599 sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-259906 class=wp-caption-text>Jonathan Bachman/Getty Images</p><p><span style=font-weight:400>To earn the super-max, a player either has to make the All-NBA team or win Defensive Player of the Year in two out of the past three seasons, or win MVP in one of the previous three seasons.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>The player must also be on the team that drafted him or has to have been traded on his rookie deal to another team.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>While Davis will likely benefit from making the All-NBA team, several other notable players will not receive supermax contracts.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400><a href=# rel=noopener>Klay Thompson</a> didn't earn All-NBA honors, so he won't be eligible this summer. However, if he makes one of the three All-NBA teams next year, he could sign the supermax next offseason, when he's a free agent. Similarly, <a href=# rel=noopener>Draymond Green</a> didn't make the All-NBA team this year but could do so next season. However, since <a href=# rel=noopener>Steph Curry</a> has already agreed to a supermax deal, only one, either Green or Thompson could potentially sign a supermax contract.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Meanwhile, <a href=# rel=noopener>Paul George</a> and <a href=# rel=noopener>Jimmy Butler</a> could have signed supermax deals or extensions if they had stayed with the Pacers and Bulls respectively. Instead, they gave up that ability when they were traded.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>So don't feel too bad for Davis. Even though his Pelicans fell to the Warriors in the second round, he's about to become a very wealthy man.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue8Crq6KbnJrAcL%2FPqKmtq12jsri%2FjpqlraCfo8ZusMCvoKxlmah6tLHTZquoZaOetK95wGajmqqXmr9ur86nq6uZk6l6tbTAp2Sapqliva2t2J6pZqGeYrujrYyhoKysn6fGbn2RbGY%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JamBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
