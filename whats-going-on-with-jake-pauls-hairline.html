In this respect, his receding hairline is one subject that continues to receive extensive media coverage.</p><h3 id=h-what-is-the-matter-with-his-hairline data-injectable=false><strong>What is the matter with his hairline?</strong></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/jake-paul-1.jpg><p data-characters=344 data-current-count=344 data-injectable=false>Every celebrity is confronted with snowballing challenges, and the youngest of the Paul brothers has not been not immune. Assumptions about the Paul brothers’ receding hairlines have been made. One hawk-eyed Redditor noticed a prominent change in Jake’s hairline and immediately took a snapshot of him running his hand through his hair.</p><p data-characters=429 data-current-count=773 data-injectable=true>The snap shows how the wavy and curly blonde hair camouflages the front area of the skull and on pushing the hair backward, balding in the front part of the hairline is visible. The snapshot, taken from footage filmed in 2018 still has people wagging their tongues about the star’s burgeoning balding process. This incident has sparked reactions amongst fans, as they are used to a certain specific kind of hairstyle from Paul.</p><p data-characters=336 data-current-count=336 data-injectable=false>The marked difference has also fuelled the discussions about his previous hairstyle called a fade. It refers to a type of haircut where the hair on the side is either shaved off or kept short, while the hair in other areas is longer. The style was renowned in the 40s and the 50s amongst military members and made a comeback in the 90s.</p><p data-characters=373 data-current-count=709 data-injectable=true>It seems like Paul’s uniqueness besides his laudable achievement as a boxer is also his ability to rock a mid to high fade. The stark reactions of the fans are common and understandable in this respect. However, it does not seem that the pronounced physical transformation has earned any positive or sensible reactions as reflected in a majority of tweets on the subject.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Jake Paul’s hairline be like: <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/8KyAiHF5N9</a></p>— Nienke (@DjBlueGirl10) <a href=#>July 1, 2018</a><p lang=en dir=ltr>jake paul’s 21 yr old receding hairline is impressive <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/wo32r67Grx</a></p>— rbk (@R__B__K__) <a href=#>November 26, 2018</a><p lang=en dir=ltr>Wow!!!!
