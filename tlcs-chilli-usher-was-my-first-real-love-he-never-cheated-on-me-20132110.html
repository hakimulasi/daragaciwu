Usher was just singing it. But people kind of bought into it, it was just the timing of our breakup when the album came out.”</p><p>“So people assumed that album was about us, but it was not,” she continued. “And Usher and I weren’t oil and water. We broke up because I guess it was that time or whatever,” she added wistfully: “he was that real love for me.”</p><p>Thomas, who, together with <strong>Tionne “T-Boz” Watkins</strong> and the late <strong>Lisa “Left Eye” Lopes</strong>, formed 90s mega girl group TLC, even admitted that she will “always love” Usher, despite the fact that the pair called it quits on their relationship in 2003.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all"><p>“In any relationship, even when it came to my relationship with Usher, when it was time to make a move, I had to do that,” she said. “I don’t care how much my heart was hurting, sometimes you’re just supposed to be with people for a reason and it’s not always a lifetime. Even if you want it to be, it just doesn’t work out that way.”&nbsp;</p><p>“But I’ll always love him, forever, because he was my first adult love, a real love,” she added. “But we’re cool, we’re really cool. There’s no hard feelings, nothing like that. It’s all good.”&nbsp;</p><p>After the pair split, Usher went on to date and eventually marry stylist <strong>Tameka Foster</strong> in August 2007. The “OMG” crooner filed for divorce in 2009; the couple have two sons together — <strong>Usher V</strong>, 5, and <strong>Naviyd</strong>, 4.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>In recent years, the former couple has duked it out in an ugly court custody battle, but it’s not something that Thomas can sympathize with.</p><p>“I didn’t have anything to do with it and I was very far away from it,” she told <strong>Us</strong>. “I wasn’t a part of any of that kind of stuff. Our relationship was never like that. That’s his story.”</p><p>Both Thomas and Watkins are producers on VH1’s upcoming biopic, Crazy, Sexy Cool: The TLC Story, which will air on Sunday, Oct. 20, and stars rapper <strong>Lil Mama</strong>, Akeela & the Bee star <strong>KeKe Palmer</strong>, and The Game actress <strong>Drew Sidora</strong>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwNhmpZ6vo2S7psPSaKulm6NisKm1y6WgZq2jnbKzedaaqmalqWKzqr7SrWSrnZGheq271Z5koZ1do7K3sdFmmqGdkamypXnOp2SmnV1nfXJ%2FkWpoaQ%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JamBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
