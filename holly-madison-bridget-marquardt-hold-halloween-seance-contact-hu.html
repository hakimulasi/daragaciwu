News</a> on the Wednesday before Halloween.</p><p>"I had this dream about him shortly after he died," Holly revealed the day before the seance.</p><p>It was a dream "where I went to the mansion and he came down the stairs with his arms wide open."</p><p>"And he gave out his big laugh, it’s like this giant cackle that he had," Holly described.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>"And he goes, ‘My darling!’ and he gave me a big hug and I could smell his cologne and I could feel the texture of his jacket," Holly recalled.</p><p>"It just felt so real," she expressed.</p><p>"When I woke up," Holly continued. "It felt like that wasn’t just a dream, that was something more."</p><p>"That’s what I would ask him," she concluded. "If that was a dream or if he really came to say goodbye."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>There was another motive for conducting the seance, however.</p><p>It turns out that the womens suspect that Holly’s house is haunted.</p><p>Bridget, who is dating Ghost Adventures star Zak Bagans, believes that spirits are terrorizing Holly.</p><p>The plan was to ask these unseen forces to give Holly some peace.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>How did the seance go?</p><p>Well, it sounds like it went pretty well.</p><p>They livestreamed the entire thing on YouTube if you have more than an hour’s time to watch them and this very nice witch perform the ceremony.</p><p>Bridget says that their mission to contact Hugh’s spirit as well as various others was a success. Holly asked that the ghosts not damage her home.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Apparently, the women heard from Hugh’s spirit, and it did sound like the rift was mended between Holly and her departed ex.</p><p>Bridget reported that Hugh revealed to Holly that he periodically checks in on her life and her well-being from beyond the grave.</p><p>There were no weird special effects — overturned tables or flickering lights — because this was not a movie.</p><p>And it sounds like Holly was happy to hear from him, despite their complicated history.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Holly and Bridget were two of Hugh Hefner’s girlfriends featured on the reality series, Girls Next Door.</p><p>However, Holly accused Hugh of being emotionally and verbally abusive during their relationship.</p><p>She has spoken and written about her experiences at the Playboy Mansion, creating tension and a feud with fellow ex Kendra Wilkinson.</p><p>Now, it sounds like Holly is at peace.</p><p>It is not, of course, our place to tell anyone what to believe about ghosts, the afterlife, seances, or mediums.</p><p>However, suffice it to say that one might believe in any or all of those without necessarily believing that every ghost story or seance is real.</p><p>Some would say that Holly should have accepted the dream by itself and let it slide. Others would say that it’s just a dream.</p><p>But maybe Holly’s sense of peace is more important than what anyone else believes, you know?</p><a href=#><h2 class=block-title>Hugh Hefner Dead at 91: Celebrities React</h2></a><a class=btn href=#><span>VIEW GALLERY</span></a><ul class="dpsp-networks-btns-wrapper dpsp-networks-btns-share dpsp-networks-btns-content dpsp-column-auto dpsp-has-button-icon-animation" style=padding:0;margin:0;list-style-type:none><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-facebook" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-facebook dpsp-no-label dpsp-first" aria-label="Share on Facebook" title="Share on Facebook" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-twitter" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-twitter dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Share on Twitter" title="Share on Twitter" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-email" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-email dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Send over email" title="Send over email" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-reddit" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-reddit dpsp-no-label dpsp-last" aria-label="Share on Reddit" title="Share on Reddit" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEoaalpKmsvLCwxqiqrKGgY7CwuY5rZ2pxX2Z%2BcLTOpaOyZZ2Wsaq%2Fzqdkm6qZmbSmwIymmKuppZa%2FpcCMoaalnF2drq24zrCcnqZdqLKiusKeZJynnqmupMCMoaxo</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JamBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
