Fortunately, Pete Davidson has been accounted for after posting suicidal messages on social media and deleting his profiles shortly after.</p><p>The “Saturday Night Live” actor screenshotted a note from his phone and posted it to Instagram that thanked Kanye West for speaking on mental health.</p><p>Many felt that Pete may have been shading his ex, Ariana Grande, because she called out Kanye West for ranting on Twitter when she had a new single dropping. The stans took to Davidson’s account to call him out.</p><p>Soon after, Pete uploaded another screenshot that read: “I’m doing my best to stay here for you but I actually don’t know how much longer I can last. All I’ve ever tried to do was help people. Just remember I told you so.”</p><p>Unfortunately, trolls didn’t stop there, they encouraged him to take his life. Moments later, Pete deleted his Instagram.</p><p>That’s when many celebrities showed their outpouring love and support.</p><p>Jon Cryer took to Twitter to ask if anyone knew the 25-year-old’s location because he wasn’t able to get in contact with him.</p><p>“I just tried to text and call him, his phone is not on or out of cell coverage. Does anybody know his location? NY or LA?”</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Am hearing Pete Davidson is at SNL and accounted for.</p><p>We are thinking of you, Pete.</p><p>You are loved.</p><p>(And just a heads up, when you finally turn on your cell, it’s gonna go apeshit for a little while) <a href=# rel=nofollow>https://t.co/erUaTcPSdw</a></p><p>— Jon Cryer (@MrJonCryer) <a href=# rel=nofollow>December 15, 2018</a></p><p>Cryer followed his question up with: “Am hearing Pete Davidson is at SNL and accounted for. We are thinking of you, Pete. You are loved. (And just a heads up, when you finally turn on your cell, it’s gonna go apes*** for a little while)”</p><p>Jon wasn’t the only one frantically trying to get in contact with the actor, his friend Machine Gun Kelly hopped on a plane to be by his side.</p><p>Ariana Grande herself showed up at 30 Rock (where “SNL” is taped) and tweeted that she was downstairs if he needed her.</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>The situation was scary but thankfully, many people rallied for Davidson when things got serious. Hopefully, Pete seeks the help he needs.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCipqOesaa%2BjaipoGegmsGmecOaraKco6S7brXSZpicm5%2Bqu7Wxw2adqKpdlrO1sdFmp6irpJ67qHnSrqCcoZSWuW65xKyqmp%2BVqHq1u4ysppyhkaF6rrHDophmpqmlsW6%2FwLKqZqCVYra0ec6nZKydpGKutXnSp6NmamJqfXiBjg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JamBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
