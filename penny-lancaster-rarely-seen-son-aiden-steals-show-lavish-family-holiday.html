On Friday, the star took to her Instagram Stories to share a snippet inside her family trip.</p><p id=eLsIy4mXdW data-wc=74>Penny and her family have been enjoying some time in Marabella, Spain, and they were surrounded by towering palm trees <a class=hm-link href=#>while her youngest son</a> was enjoying the trip to its fullest, taking to the circular swimming pool while riding on an inflatable. The youngster was moving his hand through the still waters, and appeared to be wearing goggles, implying he could decide to slip off at any time and get underneath the water's surface.</p><figure class=videoPlayerClass_v1tejlff>WATCH: Penny Lancaster and Rod Stewart's never-ending garden is so regal</figure><p id=eUb6zuda0W data-wc=37>Penny didn't caption her snap, instead letting the glorious image do all the talking. We were certainly getting some holiday envy with the clear blue sky, private forest, white deckchairs and even a gazebo in the background.</p><p id=eKi6brvRZ6 data-wc=48>The family have headed to Spain as Sir Rod Stewart performs on the European leg of his tour, with the legendary singer performing in Madrid on Friday night. Penny will no doubt be supporting her husband, but she has given fans a few glimpses inside her Spainish getaway.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/3e1e8c310d62-penny-lancaster-aiden-pool.jpg><p id=eLlzdQY6ql data-wc=48>Earlier in the week, she dazzled her fans as she posed in a <a class=hm-link href=#>gorgeous cream dress with jaguar print</a>. The presenter looked beautiful in the slinky item as she carried a unique clutch bag covered with fur as she posed up against a door in the Spanish locale.</p><p id=euEcwZfjBA data-wc=32>Penny and Rod always make the most of the summer holidays with their two children, <a class=hm-link href=#>Alastair, 17, and Aiden, 12</a>. The family often chooses sunny destinations, such as Malibu, Spain and Italy.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/d82c246c2abb-penny-lancaster-rod-stewart-rod-the-mod.jpg><p id=egluZTLC46 data-wc=63>The latter holds a special place for the couple, as they tied the knot back in 2007 in Portofino. Ten years later, they returned to the same location to renew their wedding vows. They were joined for their special trip by Alastair and Aiden, as well as Rod's daughters Kimberly, Renee, and sons Sean and Liam, as well as Kimberly's daughter Delilah, five.</p><p id=efqR-fwQ0g data-wc=63>Earlier this year, the family enjoyed a trip to <a class=hm-link href=#>Australia and New Zealand</a> and back in April, Penny shared some photos of their time in the island country. In one snap, mother and sons posed inside a boat with Penny in a warm knitted cardigan whilst cosying up to Aiden. Alastair rested his face on his brother's knee whilst smiling at the camera.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/0db3f7b4112f-penny-lancaster-marbella.jpg><p id=edcMPmtLXm data-wc=38>All three appeared to be somewhat soaked, but it turns out that it wasn't a dip in the waters that got them, with Penny revealing that they got caught in a rainstorm while out on a fishing trip.</p><p id=e4f6lgaCe- data-wc=13><strong>LOOK: </strong><a class=hm-link href=#>Rod Stewart's wife Penny Lancaster is a fashion goddess in figure-hugging suit</a></p><p id=e8mG2KLJLk data-wc=52>Fans loved Penny's rare photo with her sons and were quick to point out who they resemble the most. "Lovely photo of you mother and sons Penny," one wrote, whilst another added: "Handsome boys Penny.. youngest Rods double!" A third remarked: "Isn't the little chap the image of Rod. Bless him x."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/0c1fd469d8e3-penny-lancaster-sons-celtic-z.jpg><p id=ebZkxiRYrC data-wc=31>Alongside Alastair and Aiden, Rod is a father to <a class=hm-link href=#>six more children</a>.
