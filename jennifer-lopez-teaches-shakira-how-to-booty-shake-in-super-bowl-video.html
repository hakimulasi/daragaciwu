You shake your knees, the butt shakes too.”</p><p>Then she added with a smile, “My mom taught me that when I was 4.”</p><p>The pair made history in February as the first two Latina women to <a href=#>co-headline the halftime show at the Super Bowl</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/shutterstock_editorial_10546440eg.jpg><p>“So excited to share the stage with you tonight @Shakira!” Lopez wrote ahead of their 12-minute performance on February 2. “Let’s show the world what two little Latin girls can do.”</p><p>Shortly after posting her throwback videos, the Hustlers actress <a href=#>shared four photos of herself</a> joyfully jumping in the air and explained how she’s coping amid the coronavirus quarantine.</p><p>“In this time, when it’s so easy to get down and think of all the things going wrong and what we don’t have and don’t know the answers to… I make it a habit to say three things I’m grateful for as soon as I open my eyes and then at night when I’m lying in bed I list three good things out loud that happened that day. Could be anything… and I try to change them so they are not the same everyday,” she explained, telling fans to “stay positive and stay safe.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Lopez and her fiancé, <a href=#><strong>Alex Rodriguez</strong></a>, revealed last month that they had to <a href=#>put their planned summer nuptials in Italy on hold</a> due to the COVID-19 pandemic.</p><p>“We have to go with the flow now. Everything is fluid. Everything has been just on a pause,” the former New York Yankees player, 44, told <a href=#><strong>Jimmy Fallon</strong></a> during a Tonight Show appearance on April 23. “We’ll see where the world takes us. Obviously, this is an unprecedented time.
