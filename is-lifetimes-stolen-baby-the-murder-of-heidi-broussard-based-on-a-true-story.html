This movie is part of Lifetime’s ‘Ripped from the Headlines’ series, which spotlights real true crime events that captured national attention. The film is inspired by the events surrounding <a href=# rel=noopener>Heidi’s disappearance and subsequent murder.</a> Heidi Broussard, a resident of Austin, Texas, had a deep friendship with <a href=# rel=noopener>Magen Fieramusca</a> that spanned two decades by 2019. They had met at a church camp when they were young girls and had shared a very close bond since then. That year, Heidi became pregnant with her second child, and when she shared the joyful news with Magen, her best friend revealed that she was also expecting.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/thecinemaholic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/heidi-and-magen-kvue.jpg><p data-inc=1>The bond between them was evident as Magen was one of the three individuals present in the hospital to provide support to Heidi during the birth of her child. On the morning of December 12, 2019, Heidi was reported missing along with her infant daughter, Margot, by her concerned family members. This prompted the Austin police to launch an intensive search for her whereabouts and they found that she had dropped off her older child at Cowan Elementary in South Austin the same morning.</p><p>Shane Carey, Heidi’s fiancé and the father of her newborn baby girl, made heartfelt pleas for any leads that could help locate his missing family. However, the search for the 33-year-old came to an end when, nearly a week later, on December 20, 2019, the police <a href=# rel=noopener>discovered</a> Heidi Broussard’s body concealed within a duffel bag in a car outside a house in Houston. During the time, Magen was residing with her ex-boyfriend, Christopher Green. Although she had informed him that she was pregnant, they were not in a close enough relationship for him to be closely involved in the pregnancy. He had come back home one day in December 2019 and saw that Magen had a newborn child in the house.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/thecinemaholic.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/okokk.jpg sizes="(max-width: 996px) 100vw, 996px" alt=okokk width=996 height=462 data-attachment-id=769090 data-permalink=https://thecinemaholic.com/is-lifetimes-stolen-baby-the-murder-of-heidi-broussard-based-on-a-true-story/okokk/ data-orig-file=https://thecinemaholic.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/okokk.jpg data-orig-size=996,462 data-comments-opened=0 data-image-meta='{"aperture":"0","credit":"","camera":"","caption":"","created_timestamp":"0","copyright":"","focal_length":"0","iso":"0","shutter_speed":"0","title":"","orientation":"0"}' data-image-title=okokk data-image-description data-image-caption data-medium-file="https://thecinemaholic.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/okokk.jpg?w=300" data-large-file="https://thecinemaholic.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/okokk.jpg?w=996" title="Is Lifetime’s Stolen Baby: The Murder of Heidi Broussard Based on a True Story? 2" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p data-inc=2>One day, Christopher was buying formula for the baby whom they had named Luna, when he was approached by the police with a picture of Margot. He confirmed that the same baby was at his house. Officers had gotten a <a href=# rel=noopener>tip</a> from Heidi’s neighbor, who told them that they saw her getting into a car with Magen on the morning that she had disappeared. Law enforcement swiftly responded to these cues, and upon reaching Magen and Christopher’s residence in Houston, they made a grim <a href=# rel=noopener>discovery</a>. Baby Margot was found inside the house, while Heidi’s lifeless body was tragically found in a duffel bag outside the residence.</p><p>The police detained Magen while they awaited the necessary warrants to proceed with their investigation.
