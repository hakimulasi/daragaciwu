The show ended in January 2016 and we thought we’d take a look at what the cast are up to now.</p><p>It’s funny aspects and heart warming stories drew thousands of people in to watch. The popular show is still watched by many today despite it being almost a year since it ended. As well as the comedy aspect, Austin and Ally was known for it’s music. Ross Lynch being in the series was a huge perk as he has a very musical background with R5.</p><h4>Ross Lynch (Austin Moon)</h4><p>Since Austin and Ally ended, Ross Lynch has been working on new music with R5.
